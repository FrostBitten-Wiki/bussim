  ##[Info]
  The weather is a visual feature in Bus Simulator that has zero impact to the game-play, but adds both visuals and sounds depending on what weather is currently active as you wait for the next event.
  \n\n
  It has a more than a couple of options related to it such as:
  - Performance Settings - Weather - Allows you to switch the density of the effects, from Off, Decreased, and Full.
  - Performance Settings - Rain Reflections - Allows the road and the sidewalk to have reflections if it's Rainy / Stormy. Works properly on Graphic Levels 8+.
  - Audio Settings - Weather - Adjusts the volume of rain and thunder, with varying degrees.
  \n
  You can also change the weather namely in a private server by using the !weather [weather type] and also completely disable it via !rngweather.
  ##[Weather Types]
  ###[Sunny]
  Often the most default weather type while playing the game, has clear skies and no occasional visual obstruction.
  \n
  ###[Cloudy]
  Causes the skies to be more opaque but doesn't obstruct much of it.
  \n
  ###[Rainy]
  Causes the skies to slightly be more opaque as rain falls from the skies.
  \n
  ###[Stormy]
  Similar to Rainy, this weather type intensifies it with darker clouds, more coverage, and occasionally thunder strikes far away.
  \n
  ##[Special Effects]
  In certain biomes, some weather can be changed to fit accordingly and so often have their own special effects:
  - For [Snowy](biomes/snowy), during Rainy, it is replaced by snow particles around the player. This is then intensified during Stormy.
  - For [Frozen](biomes/frozen), hail will begin to occur during Rainy, with it intensifying during Stormy.
  On the contrary:
  - For [Desert](biomes/desert), no effects happen during Rainy, however a sandstorm begins if the weather is Stormy, with dust particles flying to the North.
  - For [Lava](biomes/lava), rain is practically non-existent for both Rainy and Stormy.
  \n\n
