  "Never go thirsty again with this bandolier of assorted colas that we found rolling around in the back of a bus! Who knows what'll happen if you drink one?" -"Bus-Cola Bandolier"
  ##[Info]
  The Bus-Cola Bandolier is an official accessory that you can buy [here](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/14609231873/).
  This accessory currently has no functional usage yet and can be worn anywhere even outside of Bus Simulator.
  \n\n
  ##[Appearance]
  The Bandolier seems to be a torso strap-on made with a sky-blue fabric. Within the bandolier contains the following colas; from left to right being: [Cold Cola](cold-cola), [Bad Cola](bad-cola), [Hot Cola](hot-cola), and [Cramped Cola](cramped-cola). 
  \n\n
  The cola texture themselves also seem to be in much lower resolution and scale than their official game counterparts.

  ##[Trivia]
  - Much like the [D.I.Y Mini-Bus](others/diy-mini-bus), this is the second non-clothing accessory to be made in relation to Bus Simulator.
