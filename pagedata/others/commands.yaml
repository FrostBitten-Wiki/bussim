  ##[Info]
  Commands are a feature in Bus Simulator used to change elements of the game, both small and large. Some can be accessed anytime, while others require special permissions or access to use them.
  \n\n
  Most commands use the ! prefix, excluding the default emote command, which requires /e instead. This page will list all of the commands you can do both in public and private servers.

  ##[Commands - All Servers]
  ###[Emotes]
  Emotes can be used in all servers and are mostly meant for fun, some emotes like /e smug have special effects only visible with certain settings, and others like /e honda can be used while walking. The following are all of the emotes you can currently do.

  ###[Seat Animations]
  You can change your seat animation using !anim, however you can only do this while you are out of a seat. The command will show a menu containing a large array of emotes, made by both the creator and the community. Beta content animations will have the tag , and won't be available in the base game for now.

  ###[Colors]
  You can change the color of a few items, all of which are related to gamepasses. The ones you can currently customize are the [Mini-Bus](mini-bus), [D.I.Y. Mini-Bus](diy-mini-bus), [Megaphone EX](megaphone-ex) and [Airpods](airpods).
  \n\n 
  **!color** - Changes your Mini-Bus and D.I.Y. Mini-Bus' color, largely changing the main parts of the bus.
  - For those with the **OG Driver** rank, the Mini-Bus will also glow alongside the color chosen.
  - And those who have the **Contributor** rank will also have their Mini=Bus sparkle.
  Do note however that the color changes applied to the D.I.Y. Mini-Bus are only in Bus Simulator, and will be a simple navy blue color in all other games on Roblox.
  \n\n 
  **!mcolor** - Changes your Megaphone EX's color, changing the inner rings of the megaphone. This doesn't change your shout message however.
  \n\n 
  **!lcolor & !rcolor** - Changes your airpod color according to each side, requires having the [Colored Airpods](https://www.roblox.com/game-pass/10596401/Colored-Airpods) gamepass.
  \n
  ###[Nameplates & Tags]

  \n\n 
  **!setrole** - Allows you to set any of your role tags. Goes from highest ranking to lowest and allows highest available to be selected. Does not let you select tags that you haven't unlocked but have surpassed.
  \n\n
  **!setheart** - Allows you to choose a heart to display next to your name, comes in many varieties, ending at the Numbers Heart, at 50,000 Driver Reputation.
  \n\n 
  **!togglepd** - Allows you to toggle donation tags ingame.
  \n\n 
  **!region [emoji]** - Allows you to customize your regional tag outside of Hidden. Requires you to have the [Custom Regional Emoji](https://www.roblox.com/game-pass/678185670/Custom-Region-Emoji) gamepass and have Regional Indicators in Social Settings to Hidden.

  ###[Notes]
  You can change a couple of notes in the game, being your **Driver Note** and your **Simon Says Note**.
  \n\n 
  **!note [message]** - Allows you to change the upper note while on the driver seat, provided you have the [Bus Driver](https://www.roblox.com/game-pass/4894984/Bus-Driver) gamepass.
  \n\n
  **!quote [message]** - Allows you to change the quote displayed on the Simon Says game.
  \n 
  ###[Ragdoll]
  If you own the [Ragdoll](https://www.roblox.com/game-pass/5923462/Ragdoll) gamepass, you can press R to ragdoll on the spot. There isn't much you're intended to do with it, besides purely for comedic effect. However, there are bugs and other unintended stuff you can do with it.
  \n 
  ##[Commands - VIP / Private Server Owners]
  These commands largely are only restricted to the owner of the private server and NobleReign. Most of these involve commands that can massively impact the game.

  ##[Commands - Admins]
  These commands are used by the Bus Simulator Moderator / Admin team to moderate the game. They have more power than Private Server commands. 
  \n 
  You can also have a similar power by joining your Private Server, assuming somebody else is already in it. 
  \n\n 
  The only command available is **cmdbar/**, the other admin commands will not be listed as to make sure that it is only limited to the game's admins, but we will include useful ones for private servers.
  \n\n 
  | Commands              | Effects                                                                                                                                                                         |
  |-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |give/[player]/[item]   | Gives the player the listed item. Item name is not case sensitive, and typing "all" as the item gives the player every [item](https://wiki.wolfdo.gg/wiki/bussim/items) in the game.\n\nThe items can also be given with an unfinished input, assuming though that the letters that are inputted match the same as the item.\n\nExamples:\nhg[give/all/sp] will give Sparkler, Sparkler Candle, Spronkbib Popsicle, Cup Dispenser, and Spray Bottle, as all contain the inputted letters.\nhg[give/all/spra] will only give Spray Bottle, as it is the only matching item with the letters inputted.\n\nDo note that items obtained from this method aren't permanent. You will still need to do their intended methods in obtaining for them to be permanent.
  |refresh/[player]       | Respawns the player and puts them exactly where they were. Not including a playername will respawn the user instead.
