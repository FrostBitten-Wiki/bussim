  ##[Info]
  Cosmetics are custom-made accessories tailored to a specific user with custom effects and sounds, mainly to NobleReign's friends. They may also appear in NobleReign's other games as well.
  \n\n
  Almost all of them usually require the player to also have a specific accessory for it work, to prevent instances of it overlapping outfits without intent.
  \n\n
  While this page does not list their ROBLOX Username, it'll instead be replaced by what they go by online.
  \n\n
  (<12px>(Note: These cosmetics are exclusively to their own players and cannot be obtained by requesting it. The majority also seldom plays any of NobleReign's games but it is possible to still witness them.))

  ##[Zeon]
  Her cosmetic is one of the more advanced, being similar of that to Tazer. It's visible only when she's wearing the Cyber Critter head and has multiple expressions. It also makes a 'beep' sound when taking damage.
  \n\n
  It is extremely improbable you'd see her cosmetic however, due to her no longer being affiliated within the furry community.

  |--------------|--------------|--------------|
  | Halloween    | Her visor color changes to Orange during October.                                                                                                                                                   | ![256x256](/bussim-assets/images/others/cosmetics/Zeon-October.webp)      |
  | Happy        | Zeon has a happy expression, you'll see her visor like this most commonly, when she's not taking damage.                                                                                            | ![256x256](/bussim-assets/images/others/cosmetics/Zeon-Default.webp)      |
  | Neutral      | Neutral is a smaller, but still noticable expression as a transition from Pained to Happy. It's harder to notice, as it switches to Happy after roughly a second.                                   | ![256x256](/bussim-assets/images/others/cosmetics/Zeon-Neutral.webp)      |
  | Hurt         | Zeon would flinch when damage was taken from anything. It's easily noticeable after taking damage, as it also makes a beeping sound. The expression lasts a few seconds, then switches the Neutral. | ![256x256](/bussim-assets/images/others/cosmetics/Zeon-Hurt.webp)         |
