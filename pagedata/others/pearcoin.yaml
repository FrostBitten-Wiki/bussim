  ##[Info]
  The <float>hr[Pearcoin^(TM)]</float> is a gamepass that is only obtainable through [Pear](npcs/pear),  or through somebody's inventory and costs 2 R$ to purchase. 
  \n
  The item doesn't appear in your in-game inventory, but is instead inside your Roblox inventory.
  \n\n
  Despite it having limited uses, it can be used to befriend [Frost](npcs/frostbite) if you pair it with an [Ice Cream](items/ice-cream), and also provide extra dialogue for [Disc](npcs/disc), [Pear](npcs/pear), and [Green](npcs/green).
  \n\n
  The gamepass is meant to be an "investment", but is actually just a scam, like cryptocurrency. You can also only have one Pearcoin at a time.
  \n\n
  Anytime the <float>hr[Pearcoin^(TM)]</float> gets brought up by a character, it has a <float>hr[rainbow and wave effect]</float>. This page is no exception.
  \n\n
  ##[Trivia]
  - If you check the <float>hr[Pearcoin^(TM)]</float> via the Passes section in your Inventory, it's related to a game that skatecar01 has owned called [Map_Beach](https://www.roblox.com/games/4588945770/Map-Beach).
