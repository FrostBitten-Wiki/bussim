  ##[Info]
  The Locker is an interactable prop found within the second floor of [The Bus](the-bus). It allows players to customize:
  - What items they can bring (from a collection of all the unlocked permanent items throughout your journey),
  - Their starting hotbar, takes a reset to take full effect,
  - Their [chat presence / tags](ranks-tags), and
  - Their avatar, albeit very scuffed than official means. 
    - Things like accessory modification don't exist in the current scuffed avatar editor.
  When you open the locker, you'll be transported into a blue space, with music commonly from the [Bus Radio](bus-radio) echoing throughout. You can always return back to The Bus once you are done, returning back to the front of the locker.

  ###[__Hotbar Layout__]
  You can customize the layout of your hotbar with all of the currently active items within your inventory by clicking on the item you want to select, and the slot in specific. Changes take effect on the next reset / rejoin.
  \n\n 
  You can also have slots empty, allowing more space for any newly obtained items. 
  ##[Chat Presence]
  Main Article: [Ranks & Tags](ranks-tags)
  \n\n
  You can also customize how you present yourself in chat, with three categories!
  !!INFOBOX TITLE:"Heart Tags" COLOR:"#ff4346" TEXT:"Earned by accumulating [Driver Rep](reputation)"
  !!INFOBOX TITLE:"Donation Tag" COLOR:"#ffb742" TEXT:"Thanks, but you only did it for the tag, didn't you"
  !!INFOBOX TITLE:"Rank Tags" COLOR:"#5c6cff" TEXT:"Earned by being in the Bus Simulator Fan Group!"
  ##[Avatar Editor]
  No, unlike a certain few games, this editor only allows you to use the accessories and outfits you have within your inventory. But it makes it for seamless editing!
  \n\n 
  ...so long as you don't mind the scuffness.

  ##[Trivia]
  - Only the Rank Tags in Chat Presence ends off with a proper punctuation.
  - You can get stuck in the locker if you remain falling when entering, creating a loop that prevents you from actually leaving.
