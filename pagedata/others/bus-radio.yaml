  ##[Info]
  The Radio is a functional prop in The Bus in Bus Simulator. It plays a large variety of songs and intermissions around the bus, and can be listened to via Airpods. 
  \n\n
  On display you'll be able to see the player who queued the song as well as what song in particular that's being played.
  \n 
  You can also either bass boost the next song in queue, or replace the next default song in queue with a manually selected song using the audio ID or by searching it up. 
  \n\n
  Intermissions also appear at most every 5 songs, manually queued or not and cannot be replaced by queued songs. It also often appears whenever the server starts. 
  \n\n
  There's also a couple of minor details such as the radio having a visualizer as well as having the in-game time more accurate compared to the Phone. 
  \n\n 
  The visualizer also comes in two different styles, being both found in Performance Settings and be disabled as an option. It goes as follows: 
  - Classic - Uses the old radio visualizer where hard beats often light up the screen from the bottom.
  - Spectrum - Uses a new radio visualizer made by Roblox and completely visualizes the music being played. Automatically turns on at graphics level 8+ by default. 
    - If the song has no audio, it'll instead do an ocean's wave.
  - Off - Completely disables the visualizer.
  \n\n
  You can also search up using either the name of the song, or with advanced filters like song length, authors, etc, with the maximum song length being 15 minutes, consuming a single song that you have **(with the exception being Private Servers)**. 
  \n\n 
  You can get more songs by: 
  - Buying the Bus Driver gamepass and joining every day.
  - Receive it as special rewards during an event like [New Years](new-years) or on other happy occassions.
  - Receive it when someone buys 2 free songs for everyone, including themselves via Pear.
  - Purchase a single song yourself for only 10 R$, if you don't have any free songs.
  \n\n 
  Currently there is no way to change the radio channel, as it is locked in 295.2 or MEME RADIO, hosted by Teddy, Tazer, Mineboom, MLGBudderCD, Pear, Starfall, Green, and Pixel_Neko. *(not to be confused by their NPC versions!)*
  \n\n
  ##[Intercom]
  Aside from forcing songs on the radio, you can also spend a song for 30 seconds of intercom, allowing you to speak through the bus speakers.
  \n 
  Do note however, that this is only accessible if you have Voice Chat enabled on Roblox, and is only hearable to others who have access to it.
  \n\n
  ##[Tracks]
  Main Article: [Unofficial Soundtracks](unofficial-soundtracks)
  \n\n
  The total amount of tracks that has been documented thus far is currently **142+, with 127 being Normal, 67 being Halloween, and 8 being Christmas**. please add in case you find a new track in the main article provided, thank you! 
  \n\n 
  Also most audio IDs that are present may not work following March 22nd of 2022, but those that do work will be bolded, mainly Roblox Marketplce tracks. 
  \n\n 
  **(Has to be a natural song, check if it's MEME RADIO or anyone as long as the player that submitted it isn't in the server.)**
  ##[Trivia]
  - There is an official Bus Simulator Radio playlist on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2QjfdDi2R24qg75CtxP7C5?si=2b4F_GM0RdKnnZWBz1S3Hw), albeit: it has a largely different playlist compared to the one in-game and some music may be missing.
  - It was first introduced along with the main release of Bus Simulator as a function-less prop, but later gained songs at July 27th, 2018, 13 days following the release.
  - There was also other channels that would've won based off of a poll in Bus Simulator Updates, the channel name and frequencies are the following:
    - Basement Records - 220.3
      - The story behind this is that the radio station shut down and had to swap to another channel.
    - Meme Radio - 295.2
      - The radio station got bought out by a soulless company, same number as originally before but more authoritarian. This is the current radio channel up till now.
    - The Meme 220.3 - 220.3
      - The radio station had to move to a different number, due to the FCC not approving their setup.
  - There used to be a ridiculously expensive gamepass that allowed you to host songs up to **2 hours**, but after a few updates it got removed. Only a few people have bought it.
  - The current radio channel is actually the same as the license plate on the back of [The Bus](the-bus), being 295.2 and RBLX2952.
    - The number is also the same as the [Sparkplug Cafe, or formerly and more importantnly known as Cafe 2952](cafe) in its titular event.
  - There's a [news line](news) that very likely references this, with the title: "Local radio station station gets bought out for 50 Robux on March 22nd, more on this story later."
    - Given how both the MEME RADIO was bought out and how the revamped playlist happened following March 22nd, it isn't hard to believe that it's referenced by this line.
  - There is an estimated wait time below the textbox.
    - If songs are queued and the length in total is under 15 minutes, the text will be white.
    - <clr:#ff8c19>(If songs are queued and the length in total is between 15 and 30 minutes, the text will be orange.)
    - <clr:#ff1919>(If songs are queued and the length in total is over 50 minutes, the text will be red.)
      - Due to a time bug, when the queue length reaches 24 hours, it overflows back to 0 seconds. However, because the queue length is still over 50 minutes, the text will still be red when the timer overflows and shows the queue length as under 50 minutes.
  - In the [Repaint Event](repaint), this is the only interior prop in The Bus that can be painted.
  - Assuming that each song actually costs 10 Robux each, it means that those who've bought the Bus Driver gamepass will receive a payment of 50 Robux every day, paying itself after just 3 days. It can't be converted back to Robux though.
