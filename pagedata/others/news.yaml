  ##[Info]
  News, or called News Articles or sometimes the News Reporter, is a chat feature in Bus Simulator. Every so often, it would report on something to make chat much less empty aside from shouts. 
  \n\n
  This also references a few different things including NPCs, shows, and more. 
  \n\n
  There's also be scripted news, which only appear if given the right conditions.
  \n\n
  ##[Lore]
  In one of the many news articles, it is said that he is inside the trunk of the bus, which just so happens to just be nonexistent. 
  \n\n
  However, in another news article by him he said that he has been stuck in the news station for 7 hours. Presumably either existing at different areas at once, or considers the trunk of the bus as his news station.
  \n\n
  Other than those two, there is no extra details about the character or their appearance at automatically.
