  ##[Info]
  The D.I.Y. Minibus is an official accessory that you can buy [here](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/14448729069/D-I-Y-Minibus"). 
  \n\n
  The accessory, if worn in-game, will change colors based off of what color you set with !color if you have the [Mini-Bus](mini-bus) gamepass. Otherwise it'll act as a normal waist accessory in any other game on Roblox.
  \n
  You can also buy it in one of the cabinets in the first floor of [The Bus](locations/the-bus), displayed as a very miniature figure.
  \n\n
  ##[Appearance]
  The D.I.Y. Minibus is made out of cardboard with the exterior colors being based off of your Mini-Bus, with the front having some crudely drawn headlights, as well as a 2D drawing of a Noob driving, and white outlines of seats and stairs in the back. 
  \n\n
  The sides has fake windows, and tires with only the front-facing surfaced colored. The back also has a fake window, as well as two tiny antennas, red brake lights, and a license plate saying "PLAY BUS SIM". The interior has a cardboard seat and a steering wheel.
  \n\n
  ##[Trivia]
  - This is the first non-clothing accessory that has been created for the game.
