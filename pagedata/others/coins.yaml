  ##[Info]
  <clr:#FFE669>(Coins) are the main currency in Bus Simulator, used to purchase apps, items, and more. Replacing [Passenger Reputation](reputation) as a form of currency in almost all purchases in the game.
  \n\n 
  ##[Obtaining Coins]
  <clr:#FFE669>(Coins) can be obtained through quests from [Pear's Place](pears-place), or through other means such as giving [Tazer](tazer) [RAM](ram), giving [drinks](cafe-coffee) to [NPCS](npcs), and more. 
  \n\n
  ##[Spending Coins]
  <clr:#FFE669>(Coins) can then be spent on various things, ranging from Paid Apps within STAR, items that you have already experienced within events, [Mini-Bus](mini-bus) designs, purchasing <clr:#8793FF>(Tokens), ranging from Force Event to an Advanced Force, and more.
  \n\n 
  <clr:#FFE669>(Coins) can also be used in purchasing within events, namely permanent items. Be aware however that the prices are exorbitantly higher as a result.
  \n\n 
  ##[Debt]
  "<clr:#a20202>(HOW ARE YOU IN DEBT???)" -"Coins"
  It's possible to go into <clr:#a20202>(debt) through means that unconditionally take away coins. This is not intended at all, as most would-be common means will simply end your purchase before it goes through, but with the [I-O-U](iou-note), it's possible to go even more than broke.
