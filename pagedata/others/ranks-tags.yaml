  ##[Info]
  There's a small handful of chat tags in the game that you can obtain by simple means, with some either being permanent or temporary. This page will go over them, and give short explanations of them.
  \n\n
  Do note that as of now, the only tags you can change is your heart tags, but other tags like group / donation tags can't be changed without having to leave the group / delete the gamepass associated with it. This is subjected to change soon.

  ##[Heart Tags]
  This category already has [its own page](reputation), but for convenience purposes, here's a quick list on all of the hearts you can get. You can also change them anytime using !setheart.

  ##[Group Ranks]
  \n
  | Role                           | Description |
  |--------------------------------|-------------|
  | Unverified                     | A 'non-rank', assigned to those whose ranks weren't verified manually or via the Verification place on the Bus Simulator group. You don't get a tag in-game for being unverified. |
  | <clr:#285eb6>([Passenger])     | The lowest obtainable rank in the group. Obtained simply by getting verified. |
  | <clr:#e771a1>([Verifier])      | A currently unused rank that is used to rank Unverified players up to Passenger. This rank is largely redundant compared to what Authenticator can do. |
  | <clr:#00bd2f>([Driver])        | The most commonly obtained rank, as it's incredibly easy to get. You need to meet the vague requirements to get the Driver rank, which requires the following to get:\n\n> Be verified in the group\n> Certain amount of messages sent in-game in total\n> Certain amount of Driver Reputation (mostly 10 rep at minimum)\n\nOwning the [Driver Gamepass](https://www.roblox.com/game-pass/4894984/Bus-Driver) also helps with the process, but is not required to own, nor does it give you the Driver rank automatically. Drivers get "+14" additional driver rep, which gives you more Kick Off priority but doesn't contribute to Heart progression. |
  | <clr:#e1a200>([OG Driver])     | An unobtainable rank that was given to as many people with the Driver rank as possible before Driver was made obtainable again following the Auto-Rank's implementation. OG Driver gets a free [Mini-Bus](mini-bus) <small>(if the player doesn't own one)</small>, and it's sparkly. You also get "+16" additional driver rep. |
  | <clr:#30ee53>([Best Driver])   | A rank that only efeuc can have. It's mainly a cosmetic tag, like Group Bot and Noble. He also has "+18" additional driver rep. |
  | <clr:#f43f08>([Contributor])   | You can obtain the rank by contributing to the game in some way, like making a seat anim, clothing, etc. Contributors get a free [Balloon](balloon) and [Mini-Bus](mini-bus) <small>(if the player doesn't own one)</small> which is sparkly. Those in the Contributor rank also get "+20" additional driver rep. |
  | <clr:#8e40ed>([Knitter])       | This rank is for people who are trusted with managing the group's store due to their vast and/or unique contributions. There may be some vague requirements aside from that. This role is currently held by Pear (for his many shirts) Ocublox and Brew4U (for creating the Bus Sim UGC). |
  | <clr:#8729b1>([Authenticator]) | A rank similar to Verifier, but has more powers, like exiling people, deleting messages, etc. The rank is very rare, and only has two members, Ectta and Zeon. They also have admin powers by default. |
  | <clr:#9100c1>([Developer])     | A co-owner like rank that shows people who is a main developer of the game. Currently only Steven has this rank. |
  | Group Bot                      | It's rather self explanatory. A rank for the group bots that auto-rank people whenever they're not broken. |
  | <clr:#5902c9>([Noble])         | It's NobleReign. He also gets "+30" additional driver rep. |

  ##[Question Time Tags]
  You can also get tags, albeit temporarily by based off of the answers you choose during Question Time, all of the tags so far can be found over [here](question-time).

  ##[Trivia]
  - Despite Verifier being a tag that is normally exclusive similar to Contributors, Authenticators and such; it's currently possible for Verifiers to get auto-ranked to Drivers accidentally due to the current system.
  - There used to be a Broken Heart [💔] tag, that was for the 10 Driver rep milestone. This was shortly replaced with the Beating Heart [💗]
  - Around mid-late 2023, the Knitter rank was temporarily given to those who submitted a lot of shirts to the group store, due to many clothing items being submitted during that time. Those in the rank also got a commission of the group's earnings. This was later changed to everyone being assigned to Contributor with decreased commissions, until commissions as a whole for the rank were removed after community feedback.
  - The <clr:#001793>([Passenger]) role used to be under <clr:#001793>(this particular color) when it was first released. It was later changed sometime after the Phone Overhaul Update to <clr:#285eb6>(a much brighter shade.)
