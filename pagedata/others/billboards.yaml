  Not to be confused with the advertisements in the [Nostalgic](biomes/nostalgic) biome.

  ##[Info]
  The billboards are props that appear within the vast majority of biomes, often showcasing real advertisements from companies and sometimes crossovers, examples are Nike, H&M, and Metallica x Piggy.
  \n\n
  If there are no advertisements shown, it'll use one of Bus Simulator's community-made advertisements, very much being jokes and references, with some advertising NobleReign's various games outside of Bus Simulator.
  ##[Trivia]
  - The update also added a couple new lines to [Pear](pear) related to advertising, if the account age is 12 or younger.
    - Unfortunately, it is now archived because of the game now remaining as 13+ after constant back-and-forth.
