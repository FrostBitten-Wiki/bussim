  Not to be confused with the advertisements in the [Nostalgic](biomes/nostalgic) biome.

  ##[Info]
  The billboards are props that appear within the vast majority of biomes, often showcasing real advertisements from companies and sometimes crossovers, examples are Nike, H&M, and Metallica x Piggy.
  \n\n
  If there are no advertisements shown, it'll use one of Bus Simulator's community-made advertisements, very much being jokes and references, with some advertising NobleReign's various games outside of Bus Simulator.
  \n\n
  Both official and community ads can only be seen by people that are 13+, and people 12 or younger can only see community ads.

  ##[Community Advertisements]
  Here's all of the images of all of the community-made advertisements. These advertisements shows up when there is no
  available Roblox ADs to show on the billboard.
