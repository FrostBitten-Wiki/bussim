  ##[Info]
  Rider is a free pre-installed application that tracks various things throughout your entire bus journey, from events, currently playing radio songs, current bus driver, badges, items, and various stats within the game. The UI will also be tinted according to your name color.
  \n\n
  The app is composed of 4 main sections, En Route, Badges, Statistics, and Almanac.
  ##[En Route]
  En Route is the home of Rider, composed of what song is currently being placed on the [Bus Radio](bus-radio), the time elapsed since you started boarding the bus (your current session time), and patch notes.
  \n\n 
  You can also remotely request for songs without needing to physically go to the Radio, assuming you either have enough Robux or songs to fill in. Furthermore, it also shows your estimated arrival (N/A), where you are headed (Stevensville, MT), and the vehicle system software.
  ##[Driver]
  The Driver shows who is currently the Bus Driver, showing their Driver Reputation, avatar, note, hours of time they drove, and their status / role. You can also check if said driver has already been thanked or not.
  \n\n 
  If you view this **as** the Bus Driver however, the thank button will be replaced with the quote "Why are you on your phone?!".
  ##[Badges]
  The Badges is your main collection of badges, all visible in-game. It shows you your most recently unlocked badges, and other locked badges that are normally obtainable alongside a timestamp of when you unlocked them. 
  \n\n 
  Interacting with any of the badges allows you to check their full description as well as an interactable model of said badge. 
  \n\n 
  For any badges that are no longer obtainable such as limited time badges, or badges that requires Robux, they will be considered hidden. They won't count towards 100% and are only visible if you had unlocked them previously. Same goes for Addicted and No Sleep, being badges that require extraordinary session times to obtain.
  ##[Statistics]
  The one of the main courses of Rider. It showcases the majority of things you have experienced or done throughout your journey, and includes some obscure statistics. The stats are of the following:

  ##[Almanac]
  The Almanac is a journal log of all of the events, biomes, and items you have experienced throughout your journey. All three of which has a bar that shows how many you have seen and ones you have not seen. 
  \n\n 
  Likewise, any items or events that aren't normally attainable are considered hidden, and won't count towards the total collection. Robux-paid items also are considered hidden. 
  ##[Trivia]
  - The icons for each of the events are made by FangedWerewolf (@noobbiom), same person who made the [Birch Forest](birch-forest).
    - As for why, Noble liked the idea of each event being drawn instead of being a screenshot of each event. 
  - In the Statistics section, a render of your avatar can be seen behind the stats.
  - Unlike the [Bus Radio](bus-radio), the radio UI within the En Route finishes with the text before it restarts, which often leads to some songs with very long names to now be fully seen.
  - If you have [Pretty Fun, Addicted or No Sleep](badges) before the Phone was overhauled, the Longest Session tracker will default to the highest badge among the three, being h[1, 12, and 24] respectively.
    - For example, if you have h[Addicted], it will default to h[12 hours].
