  ##[Trivia]
  - The items that can't be purchased but are part of the events are those that are only purchasable (and permanent) with <clr:#FFE669>(Coins) or originally [Passenger Reputation](reputation).
    - Examples such as [Compass](compass), [Gas Station Coil](gas-station-coil), [Gas Station Ice Cream](gas-station-ice-cream) and [Flying Skillbook](flying-skillbook) all can be purchased with <clr:#FFE669>(Coins) but aren't on the Shop.
    - Other items that are specifically limited / are now classified as unobtainable cannot be purchased in the <clr:#FFE669>(Coins) Shop, as well as items obtained through [NPCS](npcs).
      - Examples of this are the [Candied Cane](candied-cane), [Hoverboots](hoverboots), [Frozen Chocolate](frozen-chocolate), and [Magic Mirror](magic-mirror).
  - Items such as Liquid Void and Almond Water are not permanent when bought with <clr:#FFE669>(Coins), and are meant to be unlocked manually.
  - Axel's line of exploring the outdoors is a reference to The Stanley's Parables' one or two achivements being Go Outside and Super Go Outside, both requiring extraordinarily long amounts of waiting before launching the game, with the first taking 5 years, and the second taking 10 years.\n...It's all based on your system time anyways, you can just set it to a deacde or two in the future.
  - Axel's / Cerus' / Disc's line for staring at yourself in the mirror is the exact same as Axel / Disc / Cerus.
    - The three all reference Undertale, in which during the later segments of the game, you can inspect yourself in the mirror again for the aforementioned line.
  - Cerus' line for getting the knife plays a sound for the first-time it's been clicked on.
  - D6's first line for answering Ectta's questions "god may judge you, but his sins outnumber your own" is a reference to a post on Tumblr by user afabbaeddel.
  - D6's first line for appreciating a biome “i hate biomes.” is an indirect reference to Left 4 Dead, specifically Francis' gimmick of expressing his hatred for many things.

  - D6's second line for bothering the driver and fourth line for getting food are both quotes from The Fesh Pince of Blair, a 2011 YouTube Poop created by KroboProductions.
  - D6's third line for escaping the Backwalls is a compilation of many, **many** buzzwords all patchworked together in a single line conceived by a single opossum, of which are the following:
    - *Shoegaze* is a subgenre of indie and alternative rock that focuses primarily on soft, melancholy, ethereal sounds and vocals.
    - *A liminal space* is a location that depicts a sense of uncertain transition, often instilling an eerie, dreamlike feeling.
    - *A biblically accurate angel* is often depicted as a cluster of eyes and wings, often coupled with the phrase, “be not afraid”. They saw popularity around 2020 for their unsettling nature.
    - *Analog horror* is a subgenre of horror that focuses on the use of found footage and often edited to resemble old VHS or FM radio formats.
    - *An indie game* is a game developed and published by an individual or a small development team.
    - *Stillwater, or Still water* refers to water found in places like basements or underground areas that has stagnated and become overgrown with contaminants like bacteria, chemicals, and brain-eating amoebas. It is said twice here.
    - *Midwestern Emo* is a subgenre of emo music originating from the Midwestern United States. The subgenre features an emphasis on deeply personal and emotional lyrics coupled with intricate guitar work and song structures.
    - *Realistic portrayals of mental illness in film* were popularized online around 2022, around the release of the movie Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, which was praised for offering a nuanced and accurate depiction of an anxiety-induced panic attack.
    - *Urban exploration* refers to the recreational activity of exploring manmade structures, typically abandoned buildings.
    - *Diner that serves [...] the old-fashioned way* refers to 'This 97-year-old diner still serves their Coke the old-fashioned way'.
    - *Cornplating* describes the act of pointing out miniscule or meaningless details in a piece of media to continue discussion about it. The term was spawned from a tweet where a Twitter user pointed out that a plate of corn was present in Encanto.
    - *Camembert burger erupts when you take a bite* refers to another engagement bait tweet about a burger that contains a high amount of melted cheese.
    - *A nothing burger* is a term to describe something that, while popular, is unimportant and lacking in substance.

  - D6's second line for getting something to eat is a quote from Twitch streamer Jerma985, from part 21 of his Elden Ring Randomizer stream with Ster. [This was said in response to a chat message](https://youtu.be/KadiI0vPrDA?si=W9k1TJbpZWKObAC9&t=3). 
  - D6's third line for getting something to eat is part of a quote said by [Coach from Left 4 Dead 2](https://youtu.be/gzclG0cXcHU?si=p7a9lQ1uNLQrQTNU&t=2).
  - D6's second line for getting the knife is a quote said by Barack Obama in [Tumblr user kumagawa's](https://kumagawa.tumblr.com/post/149460046939/had-a-dream-obama-and-the-guy-who-plays-air-guitar) dream back in 2016.
  - D6's third line for getting the knife is a reference to a series of videos by [offlain](https://www.tiktok.com/@offlainnnn?lang=en). Evil Knife Guy is a prominently featured character in their scary stories.
  - D6's first line for defenestration "little blurry stars scattered all across my room." is a reference to the song Haunted, by Laura Les. Laura is best known as one half of experimental electronic duo 100 gecs.
  - D6's second and third line for defenstration alongside Fang's second line are allusions to real-life wars that were in fact, sparked by [actual defenestrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenestrations_of_Prague).
  - D6's second line for giving them cola "if it's carbonated soy sauce again i *will* kill you." implies that the player has already given them carbonated soy sauce before, despite it not existing as an item.
    - But more fittingly, both the second and third line of this quest are an indirect response to Wesker's dialogue ("Give em carbonated soy sauce with lots of sugar, and then carbonate it in a can. I dare you." & "I wonder what happens if you just give them the Witches' Brew in disguise as a Bloxy Cola...") in relation to the same quest, hence the animosity.
  - D6's second line for working at a cafe is a reference to an engagement bait post on Twitter that was blatantly stolen and reposted multiple times.
  - D6's second line for having your color win is a reference to a [now deleted but frequently reuploaded TikTok video by user @dripayoo](https://youtu.be/LAajRslUjGY?si=2UKvhSR9TTDF52us) in which he asks the question before repeating the phrase, “eating a burger with no honey mustard” several times.
  - D6's first line for the ballpit "wait! think twice about doing this one... remember dashcon?" refers to Dashcon, a convention organized by and for users of Tumblr.
    - One of its most memorable attractions (not in a good way), according to some attendees, was a ball pit in the middle of an otherwise empty recession hall. Several rumors about it were spawned, most of which were unsavory, to say the least.
  - D6's first line for bonking your head by a tunnel "oh good, a concussion!" is a reference to a line spoken by The Spy from Team Fortress 2.
  - D6's second line for bonking your head by a tunnel is an inside joke among fans of Jerma985.
    - A 'fall joke' typically involves Jerma falling from a high place to his death in-game, intentionally or not. Chat believes these jokes to be low-effort and will often call out “FALL JOKE”, usually accompanied by '-2's.

  - Fang's line while browsing the quests, "Whew! Time to kick back and chew some chocolate!.. well, if I wasn't banned from it." is a mostly butchered [They Live](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/They_Live) reference, but is more appropriately, a [Brainmold Cafe](https://brainmoldcafe.miraheze.org/wiki/Pocketwatch) reference from one of the Pocketwatch's dynamic descriptions.

    - It was however, nerfed even further following complaints, now ranging with a final 4-8 range.
