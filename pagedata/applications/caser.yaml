  ##[Info]
  The Caser app is a paid external application that costs 1000 Coins to download. The app allows you to customize the casing of your phone, either by material, color, or adding a decal to it. It also includes a history of your previous cases and what settings and time they were used.
  \n\n 
  Within the Case Builder, you can import any Image ID (or Decal) either from the Roblox Marketplace or by your own Decal Creations at an extra fee of <clr:#45ff45>( R$). You can customize both the Body of the case and the Buttons individually, each fitted with a color picker, HEX and RGB values and you can customize the material of the case to any of Roblox's preset materials.
  \n\n
  Once you are done, you can save changes for it to instantly apply to your phone case. You can also set the case to default to restart the process and toggle the case if you want to hide your case from others.

  ##[Trivia]
  - Based on the description, it's implied that the new [phone](phone-overhauled) contains hyper-advanced nanotechnology that can cause a *variety* of side-effects, although it isn't an actual feature.. yet.
    - The side effects include nausea, dizziness, headaches, difficulty breathing, sweating, hunger, thirst, throat pain, itchiness, blindness, balance issues, the common cold, coughing, spontaneous combustion, migraines, dementia, bone weakness, dyslexia, vomiting, sore throat, a sudden knowledge of the forbidden world, dementia, liver failure, lung infection, lightheadness, eye pain, muscle thinning, blood clotting or drowsiness. 
      - Aside from the typical side effects too, a sudden knowledge of a forbidden world likely implies a new world, while it could be theorized to be the [Backwalls](backwalls), it could be entirely something else.
