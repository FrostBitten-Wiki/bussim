  ##[Trivia]
  - He is one of the only few people who can actually die if fed the [Sludge](cafe-coffee). Having his head explode after consuming it.
    - Unlike [efeuc](efeuc) who suffers a similar fate, he doesn't respawn throughout the entirety of the event, completely locking away his option to recieve coffee or an option to talk to him.
