  ##[Info]
  Stanley is an NPC in Bus Simulator found within the crashed bus on the [Cafe](cafe) map. He is an OC that MediumKey made and originated from a universe where h[BloxDonalds] was a much better business than it is currently.

  ##[Appearance]
  Stanley wears the BloxDonalds outfit that you can buy on the Marketplace and wears a cap to pair with it. He also has bagged eyes.

  ##[Dialogue]
  !!DLEMULATOR EID:"stanleyemulator" SID:"start" URL:"/assets/bussim/emulatorData/stanley.json"
  - Variant 1: "Hummm..."
  - Variant 2: "Are you a real person...?"
  - Variant 3: "What a view..."
    - hg[Option 1]: Who are you?
      - "Oh, uh... I'm stanley. I work at BloxDonalds. Or, uh, at least I was."
      - "I'm not really sure how I got up here to be honest... All I remember is what happened beforehand..."
      - "[Some guy with blue skin](mlg) ordered something so baffling that I burst out laughing. Yeah I know, not very professional, but this is BloxDonalds we're talking about..."
      - "He stormed out angrily and told me I'd "regret messing with him," or something like that."
      - "I'm guessing it was the guy who got me here, but I've got no clue HOW he got me here. I'm not complaining too much though, I love this view."
      - "Anyway, uh, can you do me a favor? If you see my friend Axel around, can you tell him I'll be gone for a while? I need to figure out where I am, and how to get down from here..."
        - hg[Option 1]: No offence, but you're weird.
          - "WHAT??? High offence, I'll have you know that I graduated in the top of my class in the BloxDonalds New Staff Orientation, and I can grill a perfect burger in under a minute! *Do you think I'm playing games here?!"*
            - hg[Option 1]: Honestly yeah
              - (The player is then [defenestrated](https://www.roblox.com/badges/2141806851/DEFENESTRATED), being launched out of the bus and taking massive damage in the process.)
            - hg[Option 2]: I'm sorry,,,
              - "Good. You better be. Think before you speak next time, yeah?"
        - hg[Option 2]: No thanks, but good luck!
          - "Awh, okay. I'll try to find him myself then, but it'll definitely take a lot longer... Thanks for the luck, anyway."
        - hg[Option 3]: Uh... sure.
          - "Thanks!"
        - hg[Option 4]: Who's Axel???
          - "Oh, right, uh... He wears purple stuff all the time, and I think his shirt is plaid? He's a Bloxy Cola addict too. Always carries around an entire freezer of that stuff. You'll know him when you see him."
            - hg[Option 1]: Okay, sure. I'll tell him.
              - "Thanks!"
            - hg[Option 2]: I won't tell him.
              - "Then why'd you bother making me explain his appearance...?"
    - hg[Option 2]: Let's Talk!
        - "Uh-huh?"
            - hg[Option 1]: Favorite BloxDonalds order?
                - "It's gotta be the Burger Bob. Love those things."
                - "It's got lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, mayo, flour, tumeric, Himalayan salt, sweetened pickles, mustard, caramelized onions, and a jumbo patty..."
                - "Oh, and can't forget the special BloxDonalds sauce... Just thinking about it makes me hungry..."
                  - hg[Option 1]: You get edible food???
                    - "!"
                    - "What do you mean by that?! BloxDonalds cares greatly about the quality of their product, all of our food is perfectly edible! hg[well, when it is when it isn't Reds shift...]"
                      - hg[Option 1]: I wish to live in a universe where that were true.
                        - "What?! Implying that it's so bad you'd need to *move universes???* Ugh, I'm done talking with you..."
                      - hg[Option 2]: This is indescribably false and you know it.
                        - "No, I don't know actually. We really do take great pride in using fresh ingredients. I don't understand how you don't recogni--"
                        - "...Hm. Maybe it's just a regional issue. That's probably it. If the BloxDonalds near you is having quality issues, you really need to report that."
                        - "They can't fix anything if they don't know anything's wrong in the first place..."
                      - hg[Option 3]: [Let him live in blissful ignorance]
                        - "It's fine to say you don't like it, but to say it's inedible... Sheesh..."
                  - hg[Option 2]: That's on the menu?
                    - "Yeah, it's on the menu of every BloxDonalds. What kind of BloxDonalds have you been visiting?"
                      - You: "*You get the feeling that he's missing some context.*"
                  - hg[Option 3]: Sounds good.
                    - "It really, really is... You should swing by and try one sometime!"
            - hg[Option 2]: You should come to my bus.
              - "I'd LOVE to, but I literally cannot."
              - "You see where we are right now, right? How am I meant to get down from here? I can't just jump off, that'd hurt!"
              - "Plus, your bus looks... weird. It's like mine, but not like mine at the same time...? I don't know how else to describe it."
              - "I just have this odd feeling... I don't think I'm from here, so if I went with you I might not need to make it to where I need to go. Do you get what I'm saying?"
                - hg[Option 1]: Where do you need to go?
                  - "Well, I was actually promoted by Red last week! He said I'd be transferring to the BloxDonalds in Stevensville."
                  - "I was supposed to be going there this week once Red worked out ther logistics of the trip... I hope I won't be late..."
                  - "I uh, I won't be late, right???"
                    - hg[Option 1]: I hate to tell you this...
                      - "Ah, I see... Well, I hope I don't get fired then..."
                      - "Thanks for the honesty..."
                    - hg[Option 2]: You'll find a way.
                      - "Yeah, I really hope so. Thanks for the comforting words."
                - hg[Option 2]: No, not really.
                  - "Oh. Well, maybe you'll get it in the future."
                - hg [Option 3]: Completely.
                  - "Yeah, I knew you would. You look like the kind of person who'd get it."
                  - "I wish you good luck on your journey, I hope you wish me good luck through mine."
            - hg[Option 3]: How's BloxDonalds going?
              - "I don't know how it's doing right now, but last time I was there, business was rather slow..."
              - "I remember throwing out some expired ingredients, but Red kept fishing them out of the garbage and putting them back into the food. He kept insisting to use them as a 'cost-cutting measure'..."
              - "Yeah, I... never really got along with him. I hope he's worried about me being gone, though..."
            - hg[Option 4]: Where are you from? 
              - "Well, I lived across the street from a gas station... I never paid attention to the name, but I think they [only hired goats or something](goat-station)?"
              - "I always passed by in the morning to grab some Bloxiade for later in the day, It's incredible how much stock they always had, I guess not many people drove by... hg[or maybe it was their outrageous price tags...]"
              - "There were other weird things about that place too, like that house across the street that just had nobody living in it. Who put that trampoline there? Why's there a grill in the backyard?" 
              - "I don't think the two people from the gas station lived there, and I couldn't find anyone else around who would've. I've always wondered about that..."
                - hg[Option 1]: Isn't that where Zeon and MLG live?
                  - "Who and what now? I've never heard of those names in my life..."
                  - "Well- wait... The second name sounds familiar... MLG..."
                  - "I think I might've seen them before, while I was at work... I don't remember seeing them in that house, though? And I've been living there for like a year now..."
                - hg[Option 2]: How did you get to work?
                  - "I took the bus, of course!"
                  - "I'm not really sure how I'm gonna make my commute once I get back home though. You know, with the bus stuck in the side of a building and all..."
                  - "I guess that's not my problem so much as it is the company's..."
                - hg[Option 3]: Hm. Okay.
                  - The conversation immediately ends.
    - hg[Option 3]: Bye!
      - The conversation immediately ends.
      
  ##[Trivia]
  - Based off of the dialogue, it's very probable that Stanley arrived as a result of aggrovating [MLG](mlg), as described as having blue skin and changing through realities.
  - The BloxDonalds that Stanley is involved in is drastically better compared to the current [BloxDonalds](bloxdonalds).
  - Stanley likely came from an alternate universe of the game, indicated by the potential fact that [Zeon](zeon) and [MLG](mlg) don't live in the same house Stanley refers to, but in the same exact location.
  - Stanley is one of the only two characters confirmed to work at BloxDonalds, excluding the player.
  - You can also get the [DEFENESTRATED badge](https://www.roblox.com/badges/2141806851/DEFENESTRATED) this way, giving the badge both a free and [paid option](airhorn) to obtain it.
