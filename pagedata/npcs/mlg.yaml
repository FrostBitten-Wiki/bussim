  ##[Dialogue]
  ###[**Goat Station**]
  !!DLEMULATOR EID:"goat_mlgemulator" SID:"start" URL:"/assets/bussim/emulatorData/mlg.json"

  - "Hey, what are you doing here? Did we leave the door open?"
    - hg[Option 1]: Hi! I'm here to take your stuff.
        - "Don't, or I'll make sure you never steal anything again."
            - hg[Option 1]: Sheesh, alright.
                - "Good."
            - hg[Option 2]: Don't care.
                - "Don't."
                    - hg[Option 1]: WOAH, okay! Fine! I won't!
                        - "Good."
                    - hg[Option 2]: I'm not scared of you.
                        - (The player dies.)
    - hg[Option 2]: Bye.
    - hg[Option 3]: Who are you?
        - "Oh, uh, my name is MLG. It's short for MLGBudderCD. I'm only here because of how dirt cheap the rent is around here."
            - hg[Option 1]: Tell me more.
                - "Ok sure, I play video games a lot and spend a lot of time trying to survive in this place. Living off of gas station food really does a number to the body, but I still manage."
                    - hg[Option 1]: Do you have any friends?
                        - "A wee bit hurtful that you would need to ask, but yes, I do have friends. In and out of this town. Green, D6, Zeon, and Tazer are a handful of them that live here. Noble's another one, but I don't see him in town often. Now go away, I've had enough socializing about myself for now."
                    - hg[Option 2]: Neat, bye.
            - hg[Option 2]: 'Kay, bye.
  
  ###[Drink Responses (Goat Station)]
  - If you give MLG the wrong drink:
    - No dialogue happens.
  - If you give MLG <clr:#151812>(***The Sludge.***):
    - No dialogue happens.
  - If you give MLG <clr:#E39254>(***Pumpkin Spice Mocha***):
    - No dialogue happens, but you still get rewarded.
      - This repeats even with another favorite drink.

  ###[Airhorn Responses (Goat Station)]
  - If the airhorn is used repeatedly in proximity to MLG:
    - "..."
  - If the airhorn is used repeatedly in proximity to MLG a second time:
    - (The player is then [defenestrated](https://www.roblox.com/badges/2141806851/DEFENESTRATED), being launched into the air and taking massive damage in the process.)
      - The entire response is then repeated afterwards, with further defenstrations dealing no damage.

  ###[**Cafe**]
  There is currently no available emulator for MLG's Coffee Shop dialogue.
  ###[**Cafe (Intro / Post-Idle)**]
  - hg[Variant 1]: "Uh, who're you? [Player]? Do I know you?"
  - hg[Variant 2]: "Oh, hey. What's up, whoever you are?"
  - hg[Variant 3]: "Don't know how I'm still allowed back here... Oh, hey."
  - hg[Variant 4]: "...hm? Oh, sorry, I was staring off into the void. Did you need something?"
  - hg[Variant 5]: "Bestie haiiii, how're you!! Hiiii :]" (Friend-Exclusive)
    - hg[Option 1A]: Know where a mechanic is? (This option is unavailable after [lnro](lnro) starts to fix The Bus herself.)
      - "A mechanic? Oh, is that bus out there broken?"
      - "Well, [Tazer](tazer) would probably help, but he's busy working on his Mini-Bus like always."
      - "Maybe lnro could help you out? She's the owner of this cafe."
      - "Oh, but she's the only one on staff today, apparently. She'll probably be exhausted after work..."
        - hg[Option 1]: Aren't you staff?
          - "Uh, no? Why would you think of that?"
            - hg[Option 1]: Can I get a large coffee? Er, veinte coffee? Venting??
               - <clr:#ff4545>("I don't work here. Go away.")
                - hg[Option 1]: But my coffee... 
                  - <clr:#ff4545>("Don't care, didn't ask, get out of my sight.")
                - hg[Option 2]: Ok :(
             - hg[Option 2]: You're behind the counter?
                - "Oh, I just stand back here 'cause it's nice and quiet, and it lets me get a good stretch in. Nobody's tried to stop me, so I don't think anyone cares... Plus, this place doesn't pay nearly enough for me to want to work here..."
                  - hg[Option 1]: Move, then. I'm taking over.
                    - "You're... gonna work? Really?"
                    - "I can't say that I'd do it in this economy, but I guess I respect the grind."
                    - "The store isn't open right now though... You'd need to ask lnro. She's over there cleaning that window."
                  - hg[Option 2]: I need to find an employee. 
                    - "Good luck with that."
                  - hg[Option 2]: Why are you HERE anyway?
                    - "A bunch of my friends hang out here, and it's usually pleasant and quiet. The Pumpkin Mochas they sell here are great too, I get one every time I visit. You should try one. You should get me one too, even."
                      - hg[Option 1]: I.. don't like pumpkin.
                        - "... Ok." 
                      - hg[Option 2]: Okay, bye.
            - hg[Option 3]: Nevermind.
                - "See you later? Or not."
        - hg[Option 2]: I can help. 
          - "You.. want to help her?"
          - "Oh, I get it! If she has more staff, she'll have her hands free for you!"
          - "Not a bad idea.. Let me call her over."
          - "HEY, LNRO!"
            - lnro: "What's up? Who's this?"
              - "This is.. uh.. what's your name?"
                - You: "[Player]."
                  - "This is [Player]. They were on that bus outside, and need someone to fix it."
                    - lnro: "Oh, I see. I'm not sure if I can do that today, we're alreaady short-staffed..."
                      - "That's why they're gonna help you today!"
                        - lnro: "Huh? Help me? I guess I wouldn't mind a helping hand..."
                        - lnro: "That should work then. You go serve the customers and make the drinks, while I go out there and fix your bus. Deal? Deal."
                        - lnro: "MLG, you're gonna have to move so they can take orders."
                          - "Right, sorry."
                            - Following this will start the minigame.
    - hg[Option 1B]: Mechanic? (Replaces Option 1; Available if the player has started and finished the minigame earlier today.)
      - "You again? Same thing?"
        - hg[Option 1]: Actually... 
          - "Don't feel like working? I get that. I won't tell her."
        - hg[Option 2]: Yup.
          - "LNROOO!!"
            - lnro: "Huh? OH- Them again?!"
            - lnro: "Alright, then. Same deal. You run the store, I fix the bus. Ready? Go."
              - Following this will start the minigame.
    - hg[Option 2]: Do you... work here?
      - "Uh, no? Why would you think that?"
        - hg[Option 1]: Can I get a large coffee? Er, veinte coffee? Venting??
          - <clr:#ff4545>("I don't work here. Go away.")
            - hg[Option 1]: But my coffee... 
              - <clr:#ff4545>("Don't care, didn't ask, get out of my sight.")
            - hg[Option 2]: Ok :(
        - hg[Option 2]: You're behind the counter?
          - "Oh, I just stand back here 'cause it's nice and quiet, and it lets me get a good stretch in. Nobody's tried to stop me, so I don't think anyone cares... Plus, this place doesn't pay nearly enough for me to want to work here..."
            - hg[Option 1]: I need to find an employee. 
              - "Good luck with that."
            - hg[Option 2]: Why are you HERE anyway?
              - "A bunch of my friends hang out here, and it's usually pleasant and quiet. The Pumpkin Mochas they sell here are great too, I get one every time I visit. You should try one. You should get me one too, even."
                - hg[Option 1]: I.. don't like pumpkin.
                  - "... Ok." 
                - hg[Option 2]: Okay, bye.
        - hg[Option 3]: Nevermind.
          - "See you later? Or not."
    - hg[Option 2]: Why are you blue?
      - "A bit rude to just ask somebody that out of nowhere..."
        - hg[Option 1]: Yeah, okay. But why?
          - "Ugh, fine."
          - "It's a side effect of multiversal travel. I used my tech too much and now I'm all blue. Thankfully that's the only side effect... <small>hg[The only one I notice, at least.]</small>"
            - hg[Option 1]: Multiversal what now???
              - "Yeah, I kind of... invented my own form of it. It's very useful for getting around. Turning blue was worth it, in my opinion."
              - "I'm not gonna go into any more detail, 'cause I don't want you to copy me. Can't spill all my secrets."
            - hg[Option 2]: That's really cool. 
              - "Oh, uh, glad you think so. I worked really hard on it."
            - hg[Option 3]: Skill issue. 
              - "WOW, okay. Do you know how long it took for me to figure this out? This is MULTIVERSAL TRAVEL we're talking about. ALTERNATE UNIVERSES."
              - "I'd like to see YOU come up with the formula for it, let alone acquiring the hardware. The nerve."
            - hg[Option 4]: Uh, okay.
              - "Yeah, it's.. it's complex."
        - hg[Option 2]: Oops, sorry.
          - "Yeah, whatever. Buzz off."
    - hg[Option 3]: Bye. 
      - "Oh, bye?"
  ###[**Cafe (During / Post-Minigame)**]
  - hg[Variant 1]: "Oh, uh, yeah..?" 
  - hg[Variant 2]: Aren't you meant to be working..?
  - hg[Variant 3]: Need something..? Just as long as it's not work-related?
  - hg[Variant 4]: Had enough of working food service yet?
    - hg[Option 1]: Why are you blue? 
      - "A bit rude to just ask somebody that out of nowhere..."
        - hg[Option 1]: Yeah, okay. But why?
          - "Ugh, fine."
          - "It's a side effect of multiversal travel. I used my tech too much and now I'm all blue. Thankfully that's the only side effect... <small>hg[The only one I notice, at least.]</small>"
            - hg[Option 1]: Multiversal what now???
              - "Yeah, I kind of... invented my own form of it. It's very useful for getting around. Turning blue was worth it, in my opinion."
              - "I'm not gonna go into any more detail, 'cause I don't want you to copy me. Can't spill all my secrets."
            - hg[Option 2]: That's really cool. 
              - "Oh, uh, glad you think so. I worked really hard on it."
            - hg[Option 3]: Skill issue. 
              - "WOW, okay. Do you know how long it took for me to figure this out? This is MULTIVERSAL TRAVEL we're talking about. ALTERNATE UNIVERSES."
              - "I'd like to see YOU come up with the formula for it, let alone acquiring the hardware. The nerve."
            - hg[Option 4]: Uh, okay.
              - "Yeah, it's.. it's complex."
        - hg[Option 2]: Oops, sorry.
          - "Yeah, whatever. Buzz off."
    - hg[Option 2]: Want a drink?
      - "Uh, sure I guess. If I had to pick anything it'd be a Pumpkin Spice Mocha. They taste so good here!"
    - hg[Option 3]: Nevermind.
      - "Oh, bye?"

  ###[**Cafe (Evaluation)**]
  - If the players have <clr:#45ff45>(successfully) provided almost all of the customers with the correct order:
    - "Huh. You did better than I thought you would."
    - "Nice job. She put the cafe in good hands, I guess. You'll probably get some compensation for your time."
  - If the players have <clr:#ff0000>(failed) to provide almost all of the customers with the correct order:
    - "Wow. That was pretty lousy."
    - "What, you thought I wouldn't notice? I'm still half paying attention to you, you know."
    - "I'm not sure lnro's gonna be too happy after that performance."

  ###[Drink Responses (Cafe)]
  - If you give MLG the wrong drink:
    - "What is this? A gift for me?"
    - "..."
    - "EW, what is in this thing?! Take it back, I don't want this nasty 'drink'."
  - If you give MLG <clr:#151812>(***The Sludge.***):
    - "What is this? A gift for me?"
    - "..." 
    - "EW, what is in this thing?! Take it back, I don't want this nasty 'drink'."
  - If you give MLG <clr:#E39254>(***Pumpkin Spice Mocha***):
    - "Oh, for me? Thanks!"
    - "..."
    - "Mmmmm, that's soo gooooood. I love this place's Pumpkin Mochas, how'd you know? Thank you so much, buddy."
      (If you haven't unlocked the MLG Host yet...)
        - "Don't worry, I'm not gonna break it. I'm just gonna install something real quick, you might find it handy."
          - This then unlocks the MLG host for [Pear's Place](pears-place).
      - This dialogue repeats even with another favorite drink.

  ###[Airhorn Responses (Cafe)]
  - If the airhorn is used repeatedly in proximity to MLG:
    - "..."

  ##[Trivia]
  - MLG is one of the few NPCs that won't instantly kill you when annoyed, but gets real close to doing so.
  - MLG used to work at [BloxDonalds](bloxdonalds) at one point, but had moved away as evidenced with the Bulletin Board within the [Backwalls version of BloxDonalds](bloxdonalds-backwalls).
