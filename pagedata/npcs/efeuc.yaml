              - hg[Option 2]: Fair.
      - hg[Option 2]: This is just like the Backrooms!
          - "NO. shush, your not funny. this is NOT the backwalls. i don't even know what a 'backrooms' is. sounds like some cheap ripoff."
      - hg[Option 3]: Where are we?
          - "we are in the void, i got my two monitors for entertainment albeit one of them is broken."
              - hg[Option 1]: How do I leave?!
                  - "idk, i havent figured that one out yet.. but it's pretty chill in here, since i don't have to be running from the police."
                      - hg[Can you try helping me get out of here?]
                          - "heh, ok i'll throw you in a random direction, ready?"
                              - (The player gets flung in a random direction.)
                      - hg[Guess this is my life now..]
              - hg[Option 2]: Ah, okay.
      - hg[Option 4]: Let's talk!
          - hg[Variant 1]: "not much to talk here, but.. well.."
          - hg[Variant 2]: "oh you want to talk about something? umm.."
              - hg[Variant 1]:
                  - "hey, if you ever see grey cats run away!! i've had too many bad experiences with them.."
                      - Weird.
              - hg[Variant 2]:
                  - "hey, if you ever find a way out of here, tell my friend Darkahrii that i'll be late to The Meeting."
                      - hg[Option 1]: What if I don't?
                          - (The player gets flung.)
                      - hg[Option 2]: Okay.
                          - "thanks."
              - hg[Variant 3]:
                  - "sometimes some strange sirens starts blaring in here, and momentarily go away. i have no clue what it is, but i've just gotten used to it now."
                      -  hg[Option 1] :You mean the events?
                          - "events? what events? literally nothing ever happens here."
                      -  hg[Option 2]: Weird.
                          - "i know, right?"
              - hg[Variant 4]:
                  - "isn't it weird how we are in a world where anthropomorphic animals that can talk to human beings?"
                      - hg[Option 1]: You're probably overthinking it.
                          - "yea, maybe i am"
                      - hg[Option 2]:  Woof.

                  - "i bet i could beat you in a link cable game, but my batteries are out of charge. maybe later?"
                      -  hg[Option 1]: I would destroy you.
                          - "bet"
                      -  hg[Option 2]: What's a link cable?

  ###[Drink Responses]

    - "thank u"
  - If you give Efeuc <clr:#151812>(***The Sludge.***):
    - "is this coffee?"
    - "..."
        - (Efeuc then turns into a gravestone with the following message: \nhere lies efeuc\n\nit wasn't coffee)
  - If you give Efeuc <clr:#FFF8E8>(***'Decaf'***):
    - "thanks, appreciate it a lot, but how'd you know that's my favorite, huh?"
    - "yeah, get outta here"
      - This dialogue repeats even with another favorite drink.

  ##[Trivia]
  - This is one of the only two NPCs that can actually fling a player based on dialogue choices.
    - The only other NPC that does that is [Tazer](tazer).
  - Efeuc is canonically the best driver in the Bus Simulator universe.
  - This is one of the few NPCs that doesn't get annoyed when you spam the Airhorn.
  - This is also perhaps the only NPC that is shown to take notice of your driver reputation, as having it higher than him will lead you to the first intro dialogue.
  - Efeuc is wanted within [BloxDonalds](bloxdonalds) for making it lose an "irrecoverable h[12c] in losses". He is also meant to be detained on sight.
  - He is one of the only few people who can actually die if fed the [Sludge](cafe-coffee). Turning into a gravestone after consuming it. 
    - He does however respawn after a few minutes as long as nobody is within the [Void Box](void-box).
  - Efeucs' text voice comes from the [Ace Attorney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Attorney) series.
