  ##[Info]
  Teddy is an NPC that appears most often in his events: being both [Micspam](teddy-micspam) and [Micoff](teddy-micoff). He also has a special effect where his shadow is that of a large circle, rather than raycasted off of his body.

  ##[Appearance]
  Teddy wears a simple black-gold top hat as well as a box as his torso clothing. He also often has a megaphone at hand too when appearing.

  ##[Trivia]
  - The event originalated from when Teddy was playing Arsenal, and would play the same song with the same megaphone emote from the game, and he nicknamed it the "Arsenal OST".
  - Teddy has been referenced before in a [News Article](news), about a local toon causing a 24-hour traffic jam by singing through a megaphone.\n\n
  - The custom shadow that Teddy has is referenced from Toontown, where his avatar is also inspired from.
