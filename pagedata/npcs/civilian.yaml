  ##[Info]
  The Civilians are minor NPCs that appear in three events, [No Dough](no-dough), [Bus Stop Riders](bus-stop-riders), and [Cafe](cafe). 
  They have no dialogue and don't do anything important in the game, excluding the Cafe event.

  ##[Appearance]
  In [No Dough](no-dough) and [Bus Stop Riders](bus-stop-riders) their appearance is based off of random player IDs. The script copies the outfit of the player with the ID chosen by the script.\n
  Due to the amount of players on Roblox who don't change their appearance, the NPCs will commonly be wearing the default "Bacon Hair" outfit.
  \n\n
  However, there are also IDs for NobleReign's friends that have a rare chance of appearing in the events,
  which do also include some NPCs from events, like the NPCs from [GOATed Gas](goat-station).
  \n\n
  At the [Cafe](cafe), their appearance is created using pre-determined accessories and clothing, randomly chosen by the game.

  ##[Actions]
  The Civilians don't do much in events, but are still notable in some way,
  mostly in the [No Dough](no-dough) event where Civilians act as security.

  ###[__Bus Stop Riders__]
  *Main article: [Bus Stop Riders](bus-stop-riders)*\n\n
  In the Passengers event, three random Civilians from a Bus Stop will board the bus and take the nearest available seat,
  and will ride the bus for a random amount of time. After some time, the Civilians will get off the seat, wave for a couple of seconds,
  then jump off the bus.
  \n\n
  They don't say anything when they're boarding or jumping off the bus. Unlike [Steven](steven) from his event, [Steven Ride](steven-ride).

  ###[__No Dough / Santa's Gone__]
  *Main articles: [No Dough](no-dough), [Santa's Gone](santas-gone)*\n\n
  In the No Dough event, the Civilians act more like security, and will kill you instantly if you're spotted long enough.
  \n\n
  They will also get alerted based off of noise (for more information, refer to the [event](no-dough) page), and will go towards the noise if alerted.
  \n\n
  This is great for clearing out an crowded area, but a risky move getting away from the oncoming crowd of Civilians.

  ###[__Cafe__]
  *Main article: [Cafe](cafe)*\n\n
  Civilians will come in with randomly generated outfits, ask for a drink (if the player chooses the correct option), and sit down at any available
  seat, awaiting their drink. The civilian leaves if they recieve the correct drink, or if they haven't been served and time has ran out.

  ##[Trivia]
  - If there are no open seats, the Civilians will stand in the back of the bus, near the restroom.
  - For a good while, being roughly more than 3 years, civilians often broke or were lobotomized, but following the Bus & Phone Overhaul Update, civilians no longer break and are slightly more smarter now.
