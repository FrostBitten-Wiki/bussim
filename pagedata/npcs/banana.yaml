  ##[Info]
  Banana is an NPC that can be found in the Backwalls. This NPC rarely spawns in the event.

  ##[AI (Artificial Intellegence)]
  - It will chase a player and fling them.
  - The NPC barely moves, which can be easy to dodge on the Backwalls.

  ##[Trivia]
  - The image originates from a [Fruit Gushers]() commercial.
  - Despite being intended to be a nuisance in the Backwalls, it can actually be a useful asset, as the noise it makes can serve as a waypoint to keep track of. This is even more helpful if it's near the backwalls exit.
