  ##[Info]
  NobleReign is an NPC in Bus Simulator, designed after the developer of the same name who created Bus Simulator.

  ##[Dialogue]
  There is currently no available emulator for NobleReign.

  - "WOAH!..... *sigh* this happens every Wednesday, it's not my fault that they built this house on a highway...feel free to explore, while my bank account sobs in pain."
    - <small>(After some time...)</small>
      - "Just.. feel free to go through the other wall.. *long, defeated sigh*"

  ##[Trivia]
  - Although NobleReign has a fursona called [Frostbite](frostbite), within the game Noble doesn't acknowledge the existence of [Frostbite](frostbite), and vice versa, as Noble and Frostbite are considered two seperate characters that reflect different parts of NobleReign's online presence.
  - Unlike most other NPCs, Noble isn't annoyed when blasted with an airhorn.\n\n
  - This is one of the only NPCs in the game that still uses the default ROBLOX NPC dialogue system instead of the custom Bus Simulator dialogue system. 
  -- This is likely because the only times that Noble says something are dialogue addressed to the entire server, and not one specific person.
