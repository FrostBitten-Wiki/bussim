  ##[Info]
  NobleReign is an NPC in Bus Simulator. He is also the creator of Bus Simulator.

  ##[Dialogue]
  There is currently no available emulator for NobleReign.

  - "WOAH!..... *sigh* this happens every Wednesday, it's not my fault that they built this house on a highway...feel free to explore, while my bank account sobs in pain."
    - <small>(After some time...)</small>
      - "Just.. feel free to go through the other wall.. *long, defeated sigh*"

  ##[Trivia]
  - Although NobleReign has a fursona called [Frostbite](frostbite), within the game Noble doesn't acknowledge the existence of [Frostbite](frostbite), and neither does [Frostbite](frostbite).\n\n
  - Unlike other NPCs, you can't annoy NobleReign with an airhorn.\n\n
  - This is one of the only NPCs in the game that still uses the Event Textbox instead of the new NPC Dialouge system that other NPCs use. (ex. [Frostbite](frostbite), [MLG](mlg), [Disc](disc), [Tazer](tazer), etc.)
  - If NobleReign had a favorite drink, it'd be Sprite.
