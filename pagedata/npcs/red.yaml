  ###[**BloxDonalds**]
  !!DLEMULATOR EID:"redemulator" SID:"start" URL:"/assets/bussim/emulatorData/red.json"

  - hg[Variant 1]: "Welcome to BloxDonalds.. if you're wondering, the door is broken."
  - hg[Variant 2]: "Welcome to BloxDonalds.. blah, blah, blah."
      - hg[Option 1]: Can I get an... uhhh...
          - "Yeah, yeah. I'm guessing you're here for the burger, so, take it. ssiiigggghhhhh... I don't get paid enough for this."
              - The player receives the [Burger](burger).
          - "Hey. I said one per customer. I can see you're hiding that burger in your pocket. Don't try..."
              - Only appears if the player already has a [Burger](burger).
      - hg[Option 2]: Let's talk.
          - "Make it quick."
              - hg[Option 1]: Are you aware that somebody's hiding a body behind the store?
                  - "Don't know who you're talking about. I'm the only person here."
              - hg[Option 2]: Are you okay..?
                  - "I am severely underpaid, and we are incredibly short-staffed. We don't even get any applications, because nobody knows where we are. I have to do all the work myself, and my manager is sooooo cheap that we don't even have a kitchen. Do you think I'm okay?"
                      - I mean, I'm here..
                          - "Well, I'm not the manager, so."
              - hg[Option 3]: Wait, if there's no kitchen, then where..?
                  - "Don't ask questions you aren't prepared for the answers to."
                      - hg[Option 1]: Sheesh, sorry..
                      - hg[Option 2]: Nevermind.

    - hg[Variant 1]: "Welcome to BloxDonalds, it's not what you are expecting."
    - hg[Variant 2]: "Welcome to BloxDonalds, if you thought it was bad normally, you haven't seen this."
    - hg[Variant 3]: "Welcome to BloxDonalds, you probably won't like it."
    - hg[Variant 4]: "Welcome to BloxDonalds, the creatures are dangerous and so are our burgers."
    - hg[Variant 5]: "Welcome to BloxDonalds, not the saddest place but it's definitely up there."
        - hg[Option 1]: Can I get an... uuhhh...
            - "Our menu has changed, yadda yadda yadda."
                - hg[Option 1]: Something else.
                    - "What? Brah, this is *all we* have, what could you possibly mean by ''something else''??"
                        - hg[Option 1]: I want information.
                            - "Informatio--?! I am **NOT** paid enough to be explaining *Bus Simulator* lore on the job. Just go and read the [wiki](home) brah." 
                                - hg[Option 1]: Did you just..?
                                    - "Uh-huh? What's it to ya, <float>gonna report me to the video game police?</float>"
                                    - "Good luck with that, brah. You don't even know where their headquarters are located, do you? I don't think so brah."
                                - hg[Option 2]: Ugh, fine.
                                    - "I'd tell you where the [wiki](home) is, but that's against the rules."
                        - hg[Option 2]: Show me the exit. 
                            - "Brah, what makes you think I know where the exit is?!"
                                - hg[Option 1]: [Bribe with 5 rep]
                                    - "..."
                                    - "Fine brah. 5 rep is 5 rep."
                                    - "What, you expect me to lead you there? I'm still on the clock brah. Take this map and go figure it out yourself."
                                    - "Thanks for choosing Bloxdonalds."
                                - hg[Option 2]: I don't know...
                                    - "Then why bother asking?! Order off the menu next time!"
                        - hg[Option 3]: True, nevermind.
                            - "Pick something *actually* on the menu next time."
                - hg[Option 2]: Almond Water
                    - hg[Variant 1]: "An Almond Water for 8 rep, yeah?"
                    - hg[Variant 2]: "One Almond Water for 8 rep, you sure?"
                    - hg[Variant 3]: "An Almond Water's gonna set you back 24 rep."
                        - hg[Option 1]: Actually, nah. 
                            - "Okay brah, why bother asking then?"
                        - hg[Option 2]: Yeah.

                        - hg[Option 1]: Actually, nah. 
                            - "Okay brah, why bother asking then?"
                        - hg[Option 2]: Yeah.
                            - hg[Variant 1]: "Done. Enjoy your Void Burger, brah."
                            - hg[Variant 2]: "Here. Huh, first sale in ages..."

        - hg[Option 2]: Let's talk!
            - "Nothing much better to do."
                - hg[Option 1]: Why is there a Bloxdonalds here?
                    - "Corporate decision... Something about ''serving the universe and beyond'' or whatever..."
                    - "Different planets and timelines? Understandable. But did we *really* need a location *here...?*"
                    - "The only upside is that this one actually has a kitchen..."
                        - hg[Option 1]: Wait, what?
                            - "I *said*, ''this one actually has a kitchen.'' You've been to the Bloxdonalds out in reality, right?"
                            - "You might have more questions than answers at this point, but I'm not paid enough to care about that."
                        - hg[Option 2]: Ah, okay.
                - hg[Option 2]: How long have you been here?
                    - "How long HAVEN'T I been here?"
                    - "Brah, I couldn't tell you even if I wanted to. There's no natural light in this place. My phone died forever ago."
                    - "I should've enabled Airplane Mode..."
                - hg[Option 3]: How did you get here?
                    - "...'Cuz it's my job...? I work here."
                - hg[Option 4]: Can I work here?
                    - "Why would you want to work HERE of all places?" 
                        - hg[Option 1]: It's nice and quiet.
                            - "But it's also REALLLY depressing brah. You sit here and do nothing every day, waiting for a customer to come by..."
                                - "The days slowly mesh together, your sense of time blurs, and you eventually look up at the clock..."
                                - "Half-past twelve. But it's been half-past twelve for the past... who knows how long. The clock's battery ran dry long ago."
                                - "You'd just be stuck here. Stuck in this grimy restaurant, barely surviving off the limited resources..."

                                         - "Don't work here, brah. Maybe the gas station needs a stocker, you should go and ask..."
                                     - If the player last stayed at [Cafe 2952](cafe)... 
                                         - "Don't work here, brah. See if the cafe has a full-time spot open instead..."
                                    - If the player last stayed at [Noble's House](nobles-house)...
                                         - "Don't work here, brah. I bet Noble's looking for a real estate agent,. it's never too late to become one..."
                                    - If the player's last event was [No Dough](no-dough)... 
                                         - "Don't work here, brah. Live a life of crime if you have to, literally anything's more fufilling than this."
                                    - If the player's last event was any other event... 
                                         - "Don't work here, brah. You've got better opportunities elsewhere..."
                        - hg[Option 2]: I don't know? 
                            - "Then why bother asking?!"
                        - hg[Option 3]: I like money.
                            - "What are you, that greedy crab from *Spronkbib*?"
                            - "What money is there in even working here anyways? How many customers do you see coming to the *Backwalls* of all places?"
                            - "apart from you, of course."
                - hg[Option 5]: Are you scared?
                    - "Not really. I think I'm the scary one at this point."
                    - "You've got no clue what I've had to resort to survive down here... It's not a very glamarous lifestyle, let me tell ya."
                - hg[Option 6]: What's with the diary? (Only accessible if you had read his diary.)
                    - "*You looked at my diary?* Sheesh, can't even get privacy outside of reality nowadays."
                    - "Oh, you're wondering about the missing pages?"
                    - "Well, I ran out of paper towels, what else was I supposed to use?"
        - hg[Option 3]: Nevermind.
