  ###[Drink Responses (Steven Ride)]
  - If you give Steven the wrong drink:
    - "I appreciate it, but I think I'll pass on that one."
  - If you give Steven <clr:#151812>(***The Sludge.***):
    - "I appreciate it, but I think I'll pass on that one."
  - If you give Steven <clr:#FFD4B3>(***Mango Juice***):
    - "Oh, you actually brought me mango juice. Thanks."
      - This dialogue repeats even with another favorite drink.

  ##[Trivia]
  - Compared to the many other talkative NPCs in the game, Steven_Scripts cannot be annoyed using an [Airhorn](airhorn).
    - Steven also has no new dialogue regardless if you are friends with them, similar to [Tazer](tazer) and other NPCs.
    - Depending on Steven's location in Steven Ride, you might also accidentally trigger [Pear](pear).
  - If Steven_Scripts in Steven Ride fails to exit the Bus before the [Backwalls](backwalls) event happens, he can be spotted in the walls / corners of a room, violently sobbing.\n\n
  - If the Steven Ride event is trigged while Steven is already on the bus, it will result in encountering what seems to be a humanoid shaped stone in front of the bus instead of Steven. It then gets run over by the bus and collapses, ending the event.\n\n
  - While you may not be able to see Steven_Scripts at first glance during his introduction, the harmonica sound effect will still play before and after the introduction.\n\n
    - The harmonica sound effect is also be distorted if you spot him in the [Backwalls](backwalls).
  - If Steven_Scripts ride on the Bus and all of the seats on the first floor are filled, Steven_Scripts will instead sit down next to the bathroom, defeated.
  - Steven used to work at [BloxDonalds](bloxdonalds) at one point, but had moved away as evidenced with the Bulletin Board within the [Backwalls version of BloxDonalds](bloxdonalds-backwalls).
  - Steven is the only NPC that is in R6.
  - Stevens animations, outside of his sitting pose, are used from Bus Stop Simulator.
  - If Steven gets off of [The Bus](the-bus) without tripping, mostly due to The Bus being below speeds enough to trip, Steven's username will instead say "Oh. I'm alive.", before shortly vanishing.
