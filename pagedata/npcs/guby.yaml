      - "oh? about what?"
        - hg[Option 1]: "About the sales..."
          - "oh, are you curious about the 5% off, or the $2 off?"
            - hg[Option 1]: "The 5% off expired back in 2021."
              - "oh dear! i don't know how that slipped by. sorry to disappoint you about that...!"
            - hg[Option 2]: "Why are they only 5% or $2?"
              - "oh, my manager just told me to put these up..."
              - "unfortunately, i can't give you a better discount at the moment, even if i wanted to..."
            - hg[Option 3]: "Why is the $2 off discount only effective 6 days of the year?"

        - hg[Option 2]: "Are you the only person who works here?"
          - "oh, no. but it is just me and the manager. only two people work here."
          - "although, the manager rarely ever shows up, so it may as well be just me..."
        - hg[Option 3]: "Actually, nevermind."
          - "okay! i'll be here whenever you have any questions to ask...!"
    - hg[Option 4]: Nevermind.
