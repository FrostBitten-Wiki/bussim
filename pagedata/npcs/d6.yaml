    > A white, furry kobold with a hard hat and a design reminiscent of classic Roblox.

  ##[Favourite Drink]

  - D6 likes to make references to memes, music, general media, and his own personal interests through their dialogue.

    - Sometimes, D6 will say "7577234764 Dont forget it. It's the only way out.". The number is a Roblox marketplace ID that leads to an image of D6's former fursona, drawn in the style of Paper Mario. The quote itself is not a reference
    - ["would you like to sign my petition?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JoJUkIhEjs) is a reference to Postal 2, wherein on Tuesday, the Postal Dude is tasked with collecting signaures for a petition to 'make whiney congressmen play violent video games'.

        - "the remains of our ancestors lie beneath our feet" "sometimes i can still hear their voices" "screaming" "but sometimes its hard to hear them over my own screams."
  - The first time Bus Simulator was age restricted was because of D6's line, "why havent you been flattened by a 2 ton slab of concrete", which was apparently more than enough for the game to receive a Violence tag.
    - This was appealed, but it wouldn't be the last time Bus Simulator would be age restricted.
  - D6 is the only NPC to respond to the player spamming the [Airhorn](airhorn) non-verbally. They unequip it from the inventory after about 6 or so consecutive uses.

  - When being flattened by the 2 ton slab of concrete, the player's phone screen is cracked. This is the only known event that causes the phone itself to be damaged.
  - "her name is caroline. remember that" is a reference to Portal 2, mentioned by the Oracle Turret. The line in question mentions Caroline, the assistant of Cave Johnson who ended up being the sentience that resides in GLaDOS.
    - Another line from the Oracle Turret is also mentioned, being "the answer is beneath us", a line that in the original game, hints that GLaDOS' secret identity is hidden among Johnson's intercom messages, playing deep underneath Aperture.
