                  - "And sold! Now there's something I need to do first..."
                    - If it's an unclaimed [Flying Skillbook](flying-skillbook): 
                      - You: "Fang inspects the Flying Skillbook in question."
                      - You: "After waiting a few seconds, he begins to pull away a drawer next to him, pulling a small knife, as he meticulously cuts away each strand of glue with precision."
                      - You: "..." (This lasts for 3 seconds.)
                      - You: "Looks like he's done. He sighs in relief as he hands you the book, receipt on top."
                        - "There you go! It's way slower than how my goat friend does it but, but does the job just fine."

                      - You: "Fang inspects the Dash Skillbook in question."
                        - "Ah, this one! Wasn't expecting anyone to buy it, but since you paid your part, it's only fair to do mine too!"
                          - You: "Fang begins to grab both ends of the skillbook and..."
                          - You: "..!" (A cracking sound is played.)
                          - You: "You look back, and find that the book's anti-thief seal broke out of sheer strength, as Fang then promptly gives it to you."
                            - "Tada! Here you go! My knowledge is now shared with yours!"
                            - "Just make sure to not overestimate your body, you can dash but remember that you probably can't break walls unless your body already can."
                            - <clr:#555555>("*I mean, it's not like anyone intends to do so...*")
                              - hg[Did you just break the seal?]
                                - "Yeah... Normally you need some sort of magic thingy majigy to break it, but turns out brute force also works."
                                - "Not to say that you can break it with feeble hands though! Each time I have to break one it does require a hefty lot of superhuman strength..."
                                - <clr:#555555>("*I wonder if machinery could also work...*")
                    - If it's both and they're unclaimed: 
                      - You: "Fang inspects both the Flying and Dash Skillbooks in question."
                        - "Well dang, I wasn't expecting someone to buy these two in specific but... I'll make this quick!"
                          - You: "Fang begins to grab both ends of the skillbook and..."
                          - You: "..!" (A cracking sound is played.)
                          - You: "You look back, and find that the book's anti-thief seal broke out of sheer strength."
                          - You: "Without a moment's notice, Fang already then begins to open up a drawer next to him, picking up a small knife."
                          - You: "He then precisely and carefully cuts every strand of glue within the Flying Skillbook, despite what happened with the other one."
                          - You: "..." (This lasts for 3 seconds.)
                          - You: "Soon after the other, both of the books have been dealt with, he then slides both of them, now unsealed on your side."
                            - "And here you go! These two books are now in your possession!"
                            - <clr:#555555>("*Sorta hope you're able to digest the info from those two just fine... they aren't heavy for a reason.*")
                    - If the player attempts to buy a claimed skillbook: 
                      - "...Oh! Nevermind, looks like you already claimed it before, so you saved yourself some money!"
        - hg[Option 2]: [Ask for coffee.] (Friend-Exclusive)
          - "Oh? Sure!"
            - If the player hasn't been given coffee yet within the same event: 
              - You: "You recieved a <random safe coffee drink>."
                - "It gets a bit boring working here, so it's always nice to brew up a coffee here and there!"
                - (The player then recieves a random safe coffee drink.)
            - If the player already has been given coffee within the same event: 
              - "Ah... I wish I could give you another but I'd rather not risk accidentally making a mess 'round here."
              - "Maybe next time though!"
            - If the player is [Zeon](zeon) in question: 
              - You: "You recieved a Strawberry Smoothie."
                - " I couldn't find ya some bananas unfortunately, but I'll let you know if I can find 'em!"
                - (The player recieves a Strawberry Smoothie.)
            - If the player is [D6](d6) in question:
              - You: "You recieved The Sludge."
                - "Not the most aromatic drink personally, but here you go!"
                - (The player recieves The Sludge.)
            - If the player is [Disc](disc) in question: 
              - You: "You recieved a Vanilla Iced Coffee." 
                - "Here you go pal! Hope your gas station thing has been going well for you!"
                - (The player recieves a Vanilla Iced Coffee.)
            - If the player is [NobleReign](noble) in question:
              - You: "You recieved The Blizzard."
                - "Here, have a cold one specifically for you!"
                - (The player recieves The Blizzard.)
            - If the player is [MLG](mlg) in question: 
              - You: "You recieved a Pumpkin Spice Mocha."
                - "It might not be better than the ones at the Sparkplug Cafe you work at, but it still hits the same tones!"
                - (The player recieves a Pumpkin Spice Mocha.)
        - hg[Option 3]: [Check.]
          - You: "Fang definitely seems to be a lot more reasonable than the stories that represented them, although it is still strange seeing them work in a more... menial task if anything."
          - You: "Wait- why are you even checking him? You aren't friends with this guy." (Stranger-Exclusive)
          - You: "Aside from that though, he's a friend of yours so, he probably has his interests in mind." (Friend-Exclusive)
        - hg[Option 4]: [Leave.]
    - hg[Option 2]: Let's Talk!
      - hg[Variant 1]: "Sure!"
      - hg[Variant 2]: "Why not?"
      - hg[Variant 3]: "Anything on your mind?" (Stranger-Exclusive)
      - hg[Variant 4]: "Anything on your mind, friend?" (Friend-Exclusive)
        - hg[Option 1]: About you...
          - "What about me?"
            - hg[Option 1]: Are you (actually) a werewolf?
              - "Well, yeah. Got bit with some sort of strain that prevents me from ever being a human again, but..."
              - "I think it's better off I leave that past behind."
                - hg[Option 1]: What happened to you when you were a human? 
                  - "Private details, I think it's better you don't know."
                    - hg[Ouch, alright.]
                      - "Thanks."
                - hg[Option 2]: How's being a werewolf holding up for you? 
                  - "Honestly not as bad as I thought. The only problem is fitting in small places and needin' to eat a steak more."
                  - "Plus, there's also the strength, regeneration, and more, it's quite awesome I'd say!"
                    - hg[Are you weak to silver?]
                      - "Ouch, yeah... It doesn't sting me... but it just prevents me from healing it quickly."
                      - "I still have to spend on medical supplies in those cases..."
            - hg[Option 2]: What happened to you and those statues?
              - "All I remember was being on that bus one day until I got teleported into this snazzy podium back during... Christmas?"
              - "I stared around and noticed how everyone looked like they weren't even there. It was scary to say the least."
              - "Didn't help that there was always music playing and looping. It was nice for the first hour but became sort of annoying."
              - "It was only until like eight hours had gone by did I kick whatever field was preventing me from leaving, let alone making me stay stagnant like a statue, and found a ticket outta there."
              - "...It was a puddle, I was trying to run onto the button but slipped and got knocked out."
              - "Next thing I knew? I was out on the road. Free from that bus but had nowhere to go. It's at least a start."
                - hg[Option 1]: How did you become a host? (Activates a condition for a hidden option.)
                  - "Oh, that?"
                  - "Yeah, some guy I think who went by the name of Pear led me into this... building thing and I had to record lines for this new application he was working on. That's where I also met Zeon and a few others!"
                  - "It was sort of an office in a way, which was why my lines were as if I was actually there. Well, until Pear called it a day and sent everyone back to their homes, except I, since I had nowhere to go."
                  - "As I was walking my way down within the nearest town I could find though, I found a flyer for some worker in a library, and that's where I am now!"
                    - hg[Option 1]: Have you found a home yet or..?
                      - "Found one. Got enough funds to rent an apartment so I actually have a place to live now."
                      - "The economy there is surprisingly way better than the one I had in my human life so, honestly? Not all that bad. That and I get a talking mini-me on my phone."
                    - hg[Option 2]: My brain hurts. 
                      - "Pfft, take all the time you need to digest that."
                - hg[Option 2]: Oh, alright.
            - hg[Option 3]: Zeon told me to say hi to you. (If the player has talked to Zeon in the [Cafe](cafe) and recieved the black wolf dialogue)
              - "Oh, her! Well, I'll be damned!"
              - "Glad to know she's doing fine on her end, if you ever see her, tell her I said hello, alright?"
        - hg[Option 2]: About this library...
          - "What about it?"
            - hg[Option 1]: Why are there only two skillbooks?
              - "Oh that? Well..."
              - "Honestly, the manager told me they needed something to fill that empty bookshelf outside of supplies since ''the other store 1k studs from here has them''. So I found this Flying Skillbook thing from Disc over at a cafe."
              - "Surprisingly, it's a pretty dang good seller all this considered, so I wrote my own too!"
              - "I'll see if i can find some more, but for now it's just those two."
            - hg[Option 2]: Why is the Flying Skillbook more expensive?
              - "Expensive? That's its base price."
              - "Oh wait- unless you specifically mean the ones at GOATed Gas, then yeah, it's cheaper there."
                - hg[Option 1]: Why is that?
                  - "Something about regional pricing, the products over there are surprisingly cheaper as a result than over here."
                - hg[Option 2]: Dang.
            - hg[Option 3]: Where's the bathroom?
              - "Somewhere in the plaza. The door next to me just leads into the storage of this library."
            - hg[Option 4]: What's that laptop doing there?
              - "Oh, that's from a patreon of mine. Just don't touch whatever they're doing and you should be fine."
                - hg[Option 1]: Ah, okay.
                - hg[Option 2]: What if I do?
                  - "..."
                    - hg[...Okay then, no touching.]
            - hg[Option 5]: Where's the more... normal books?
              - "Oh those? Unfortunately they're apparently not considered ''bestsellers'' in recent times. They were once the bomb many years ago though!"
              - "Well, not like I'd know. I wasn't there during those times."
          - hg[Option 3]: About the bus...
            - "Oh wait, you mean *that* bus? What about that?"
              - hg[Option 1]: Didn't you write a wiki about it?
                - "Yup, I did. Took a good while, especially since it was also a collaborative effort all around including Zeon, Wesker, and a few others, but we finished it!"
                - "That also meant I was once a passenger like you before, until I got sent into that art gallery thing."
                - "How do I know you're a passenger? Well, I think it's pretty obvious *who* you're playing as, am I correct?"
                  - hg[Uhm-]
                    - "Pfft! Just your facial and body expressions tell me you aren't the regular folk who'd take the time to sit down and read some random book."
                    - "If I were to suggest to you though, those skillbooks definitely will be of interest to you guys, so I hope I can do my part by helping the rest of y'all, both wiki and literally."
              - hg[Option 2]: Found any way to escape?
                - "..."
                - "..." 
                - "Honestly, it's sort of just a wild guess. But so long as you contribute to this world and befriend folks like I, then maybe through some sliver of luck, you might end up being free like I, but even then that's debatable."
                - "In the meantime though... Let me know how your journey goes. I'd still be down to document whatever strange new discoveries lie within that still!"
  ###[Drink Responses]
  - If you give Fang the wrong (safe) drink:
    - "Oh, a drink? Thank you!"
    - (The drink is then taken away from the player.)
  - If you give Fang the wrong (dangerous) drink:
    - "Uh... no thanks."
  - If you give Fang <clr:#151812>(***The Sludge.***):
    - "Oh a drink? Thank you!"
    - "..."
    - "..." (A crackling fire sound plays in for five seconds.)
    - "...That was pretty nice."
      - hg[You didn't die?]
        - "Well duh, had my super-regen kick in full time there!"
        - "You really thought I'd fall following the other two didn't you?"
        - "Well, it's alright. Tasted oddly like Bloxy Cola if anything."
  - If you give Fang <clr:#FFFAF5>(***Vanilla Iced Coffee***):
    - "Hey! Vanilla iced coffee! Thanks!"
    - "No idea where you learned what's my favorite drink but, thanks!"
    - <clr:#555555>("*It's either that wiki of yours or you thought I was goat guy, huh? Well, not that I mind, heh.*")
      - If you give him another <clr:#FFFAF5>(***Vanilla Iced Coffee***):
        - "Another one, huh?"
        - "Nice."

  ###[AFK Responses]
  - hg[Variant 1]: "Hello? You seem kind of tranced there for a moment."
  - hg[Variant 2]: "Pfft, documenting something on the wiki perhaps? You don't need to, you know."
  - hg[Variant 3]: "Say hi to the Philippines for me"
  - hg[Variant 4]: "And there goes another poor soul..."

  ###[Airhorn Responses]
  - If the airhorn is used repeatedly in close proximity to Fang: 
    - "Oww... forgot they exist..."
    - "Don't forget that this is still a library!"
  - If the airhorn is used repeatedly in proximity to Fang a second time:
    - "Awh man... are you trying to get a reaction out of me?"
    - "Fine, I will warn you though, third strike isn't pretty."
  - If the airhorn is used repeatedly in proximity to Fang a third time:
    - "Well, I guess you did ask for it..."
      - The player's head is then selected using [Edit](edit) and is promptly deleted, killing the player.
  - If the airhorn is used repeatedly in proximity to Fang a fourth time and so on:
    - "Again? Well, I suppose it seems like nothing is going to get through that skull of yours, huh?"
    - "But it's fine honestly, I could keep going like this on and on, but I know at some point you're going to stop using that airhorn."
    - "Now I could just go ahead and turn off my Tools volume through my Audio settings, but that would end up making me lose Airpods privileges, and I spent a hefty lot on that."
    - "Well, a hefty lot, more like, not actually a lot."
    - "In fact, there's a lot of stuff I've bought that is heaps more expensive than two pieces of electronics bundled as one, but I'm pretty sure you get the idea."
    - "Still though, that Airhorn of yours? Honestly isn't the worst thing you can do to someone."
    - "That horn back from that bus over there will annoy a lot of people, mainly because they forgot they can turn off their Environment audio settings, or queuing up hundreds of songs, often being the most ear-jarring ones you thought wouldn't be bad."
    - "In fact, it pisses me off whenever someone queues up a bunch of that one song between a dad and a son, it's gotten to the point where I **actively** avoid that song outside of that bus! That's how bad it is!"
    - "Now I know that they'd be usually spending a month's worth of their songs on just one session, but come on! The more you do that stuff the more I appreciate the specifically-curated tracks from MEME RADIO, and it's outside of biases like my friends being the ones handling the intermissions!"
    - "Like I know you don't have many options, but **for** goodness **sake**, just have some variety."
    - "Speaking of variety, there's been a lot of songs that I've been listening to outside of MEME RADIO, and honestly? I wasn't expecting to come back to those types of songs."
    - "Like one of them was about uh, eating people, while the other is about rotting for popularity... yeah- I know these aren't really songs with good messages, but they still are personally some of my favorites."
    - "Anyways, going back..."
    - "I suppose you weren't really expecting me to go on a long tirade the moment you attempted to pull out another one on me, right?"
    - "In fact, I don't even think you have any choice of the matter, you're stuck in this very spot until either I'm done talking or you reset."
    - "But I'm not like that fox that used to go rampage on people like you on that bus, no, I won't just simply type ''blah blah blah'' and be done with it. You know why?"
    - "It's because you made me talk about something interesting. That's all."
    - "Oh, and if you were wondering, don't expect the stuff I say here to be actually canon. I'm just trying to avoid having to place meta-stuff onto that loremap that I made. I made this character so, I guess I also get to decide if it's canon or not."
    - "Specifically this though, all the other dialogue outside of this? They're all canon. Well, not like it's worth trying to bother taking not-serious lore seriously."
    - "In fact, the last time I tried to make a loremap, my head got all woozy because it turned out that Fang from Pear's Place canonically knows everyone and everything! Because he works for the wiki!"
    - "And then there's also the fact that nobody but Zeon and Guby (hey Zeon! :3) even knows that I exist when you talk to them yourself! It's a mess of a mess that I accidentally made but it isn't supposed to be my problem because the lore from the beginning was built to be not that serious aside from a few here and there."
    - "Honestly. I really now understand why stuff like this shouldn't be taken too seriously. But on the bright side, it at least all forms a sort of cohesive lore, no?"
    - "When I finished that loremap, there wasn't any conflict to be seen which... honestly is sort of to be expected when people are aware of each other and stuff."
    - "Actually, I don't even think the others but the select few not knowing Fang exists is a conflict, since they never really mention their other friends too aside from the ones involved / related."
    - "Well, at least I solved that dilemma. But continuing off of that, it's at the very least nice seeing each NPC and event here and there contributing towards something greater, something grander, usually by accident."
    - "And honestly? It makes me pleased to know that even if some guy were to take all of this seriously, at the very least it all makes sense."
    - "Anyways, where was I? Oh right, it's like... your fourth or moreth strike with the Airhorn right?"
    - "Well, I should probably get back to being in character again since I'm running out of things to say."
    - "Don't forget, I still gotta kill you for being a disturbance. But at the very least you wasted a lot of your time reading this."
    - "Unless you're like one of my friends though, which you aren't."  (Stranger-Exclusive)
    - "So...hasta la vista." (Stranger-Exclusive)
      - The player's head is then selected using [Edit](edit) and is promptly deleted, killing the player.
    - "Unless you're one of my friends though, which you are! You probably just read this to see me yap or something since you have to do something pretty specific to achieve this, so... I hope it was worth it! Which I'm sure probably did." (Friend-Exclusive)
    - "And for that, I'm.. actually just gonna let you off scot-free! Stay safe out there, friend." (Friend-Exclusive)
      - Fang does nothing. You're spared.
  
  ##[Trivia] 
  - Fang canonically knows a large extent towards the game, still retaining his role as the main wiki manager.
  - Fang, obviously has the longest airhorn response out of any NPC, totalling to 31 consecutive lines of dialogue on his 4th+ strike (If you're a friend or not with Fang).
    - The intent behind this was simply to waste the player's time, as the player is provided no options aside from resetting, as they have to endure Fang talk about many things before they die.
  - The song that he mentions about having to actively avoid in his 4th Airhorn Strike is [Plead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQfKatNaKSQ) from Forsaken.
    - While the [Bus Radio](bus-radio) can be easily disabled by turning off the Music category in Audio Settings, Fang prefers having it on.
    - The other two songs that he also mentions following it are [Butcher Vanity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjBFftpQxxM) and [Rot For Clout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AjJZEcMdww), both Vocaloid songs.
  - he is the woofer.
