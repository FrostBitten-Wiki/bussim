  ##[Info]
  Pear is an NPC sitting at the end of the second floor. If you interact with him, you can have a conversation involving many things,
  invite a friend to gain rewards, or buy two songs for everyone in the server for 80 robux, although he recommends not to after "the incident" (the 3/22/22 audio update).
  He is necessary to obtain one of the badges in Bus Simulator, that being [Animal Messenger](https://www.roblox.com/badges/2130010649/Animal-Messenger).

  ##[Appearance]
  Pear is a grey tuxedo cat that wears a Green Domino Crown, a collar, a cat facemask, a pair of pastel vintage glasses, a pair green and yellow arm warmers, and a small backpack.

  ##[Favourite Drink]
  Pear's favourite drink is [Vanilla Almond Milk](cafe-coffee-recipes). This gives you either 1 Passenger Rep or 1 Driver Rep, and 70 Coins.

  ##[Inviting Friends]
  One of the new features added within the 2/04/2023 Update, following the 20 Million Update. When you talk to Pear, 
  you can invite your friends to join you, and if you and your invited friend stays within the same server for an hour, 
  you both get 10 Driver Rep & Passenger Rep, as well as 500 coins for the invitee and 300 coins for the invited. You can invite up to 2 more friends, granting 5 Driver Rep & 300 Coins for each one, 
  but 10 Passenger Rep for each one too, everyday. You'll also get badges for either being the one invited, or inviting someone.
  \n\n
  You can also invite someone, and then be invited by the same person afterwards to get 2 out of 3 friends with only 1 friend.
  \n\n
  At most, you can garner up to 20 Driver Rep & 30 Passenger Rep as well as 1100 Coins per day, assuming your friends really like to play Bus Simulator a lot.
  \n\n
  You can also initiate the rewarding system by being invited by a friend from your website or desktop application, should be in your notifications once your friend invites you to the game.

  ##[Rap Battling]
  This can only be unlocked after obtaining a [Magic Mirror](magic-mirror), guide to obtain it is provided underneath the main dialogue!
  \n\n
  During one of Pear's dialogue variations, you are able to invite Pear to rap battle, provided you have an item to teleport somewhere quieter. Afterwards Pear will give you a cardboard microphone, as Pearing Out plays.
  \n 
  Throughout the song, you and Pear will rap battle on [The Bus](the-bus), eventually though an event will appear; causing The Bus to crash into [Noble's House](nobles-house). From then on, you battle against both Pear and Noble, alongside a difficult chart.
  \n\n 
  After the song ends, depending on your score will determine how well you did: if you exceed past 10,000 in scores then you win against Pear; otherwise you lose. You'll also gain access to play against Pear with other songs following Pearing Out. 

  ##[Dialogue]
  #![!!DLEMULATOR EID:"pearemulator" SID:"start" URL:"/assets/bussim/emulatorData/pear.json"]
  ###[**The Bus (Default)**]
  - hg[Variant 1]: "Oh, hey [Player]!!! I know you!! (Friend-Exclusive)"
  - hg[Variant 2]: "Did you know that in terms of... busses, this is a pretty nice one! What's up, though?"
  - hg[Variant 3]: "mmrrreoww~?"

  - hg[Variant 7]: "Heyaaa! What're you talkin to me for?"
  - hg[Variant 8]: "[Player]?! I didn't expect to see you here!!"
  - hg[Variant 9]: "Tender soul splintered, folded in the inner...~ Huh, sorry... What's goin on?"
      - hg[Option 1]: Sorry, just walking by.
      - hg[Option 2]: Let's talk!
          - hg[Variant 1] (If the player count is below 5): "I mean, it is pretty lonely in here.."
          - hg[Variant 2] (If there's one other player in the server): "You done talking to [Other Player]? Well, uhh..."
          - hg[Variant 3] (If there's one other player in the server): "You finally tired of talking to [Other Player]? Then, uhhhh..."
          - hg[Variant 4] (otherwise): "There's like [x Players in Current Server] on the bus and you wanna talk to me? Okay, uh..."
          - hg[Variant 5]: "That's gonna cost you 5 coins... Just kidding! So..."
          - hg[Variant 5]: "That's gonna cost you 5 rep... Just kidding! So..." (Archived)
          - hg[Variant 6]: "You want to talk? Hmm uhh..."
          - hg[Variant 7]: "Well I'm not sure what to talk about but uh..."
          - Continuation (after any variant):
              - hg[Variant 1]: "Wanna rap battle? I promise it'll be easy!"
                  - hg[Option 1]: I don't rap.
                      - "You probably could thoughhhh~"
                  - hg[Option 2]: Beep Bap! (Archived)
                      - "Let's go- Oh wait... There isn't any way for us to rap, sorry!"
                  - hg[Option 2]: Beep Bap!
                      - "Let's goooo! Maybe not on the bus though... Do you have anything that could [take us somewhere quieter?](magic-mirror) (If the player has the Magic Mirror)
                      - "Let's go-.. Actually, maybe not on the bus... If only there was a way to teleport away..."
                          - If the player uses the [Magic Mirror](magic-mirror) next to Pear afterwards:
                              - "Woah, you actually have something like that?!"
                              - "This is a great stage, but why's the mic made out of cardboard?"
                              - "Eh, I guess it'll work. Let's rap!"
                                  - (Pearing Out then plays. Two outcomes will occur based on if you win or lose throughout the song.)
                                      - If you win:
                                          - "Woah, you did pretty good actually!!!"
                                          - "That was fun! Feel free to rap battle me again sometime!"
                                          - "I've put my song in your roster so you can play it with others as well! Enjoy~"
                                              - Pear then evaporates in a green dust. Pearing Out is afterwards unlocked in your Friday Night song selection screen.
                                      - If you lose:
                                          - TBA
              - hg[Variant 2]: "Tell Frost he owes me a tub of ice cream the next time he sees me..."
                  - "No reason in particular, I just want one!"
                      - hg[Option 1]: Maybe someday.
                      - hg[Option 2]: Been there, done that. (If the player already completed and/or is still doing the Animal Messenger quest)
              - hg[Variant 3]: "I first got on this bus like... forever ago. I can't really remember when it was, even."
                  - "Although this bus ride has gone on for so long.. it gave me a lot of time to just think..."
                  - "So I did! I thought about a bunch of stuff, including myself! I ended up gaining a new hobby! I took up knitting, and it's a really fun way to pass the time!"
                  - "I think I've gotten pretty good at it.. would you like to have something of mine~?"
                      - hg[Option 1]: Yeah, for sure!
                          - "Thaaanks!! oh, what, you thought it was free? heck no, this is a business opportunity!"
                              - (The player is prompted to buy a random shirt from Pear's Clothing.)
                                  - If the player doesn't purchase the shirt or already owns it:
                                      - "Oh.. I guess you didn't like it..? I'll try and do better next time.."
                                  - If the player purchases the shirt:
                                      - (The shirt is applied to the player's avatar. (Shirt does not stay after rejoin or respawn.))
                                          - "Whuh!! You look amazing in that! I almost wanna pay you for wearing it! I'm not lying! You've actually inspired me to keep going, so I'll have more clothes for you the next time you see me!"
                      - hg[Option 2]: Ah, no thanks.
                          - "Aw... You would have looked good in it, though."
              - hg[Variant 4]: "Hey, you want some pearcoinTM?"
                  - hg[Option 1]: Sounds like a scam.
                      - "I would never!"
                  - hg[Option 2]: I already have one. (If the player owns a Pearcoin)
                      - "You do? Thanks... It's worth nothing actually!"
                  - hg[Option 3]: Sure.
                      - "Gotcha, I've fired up the pearcoinTM machine! Give it a try!"
                          - The player is prompted to buy a Pearcoin for 2 Robux.
                              - If the player already owns a Pearcoin:
                                  - "Oh, right! I forgot to tell you. There's a limit on how much pearcoinTM you can purchase~! It's one. You can only buy one pearcoinTM. That's why its singular, not plural!"
                              - If the player buys it:
                                  - "Congratulations!! You're now the owner of one whole pearcoinTM!!"
                                  - "Take it in bud, you're officially part of the 1% now..."
                                  - "The 1% who actually fell for it... sucker~"
                                  - "Thanks for your patronageeee~"
                                      - (This gives you a <float>hr[Pearcoin^(TM)]</float>, useful for befriending [Frostbite](frostbite).)
              - hg[Variant 5]: "My favorite pizza is just plain cheese pizza!"
                  - "Though black olives are good too..."
                  - If the player has given Pear a Cheese Pizza in the game piza:
                      - "You've already given me one before though~!"
              - hg[Variant 6]: "Today feels like any other day, honestly, Wonder if you feel the same?"
              - hg[Variant 7]: "Do you play.. err, that one battle royale game with the buildings and stuff? I do.. sometimes. I think."
              - hg[Variant 8]: "Have you seen a brown cat? They look a bit like, uhm... the season fall? Crown necklace and earring? No? Awh... Tell me if you do, though!!"
              - hg[Variant 9]: "I think people are confused about my gender. I figured I should clear stuff up, so remember that my pronouns are he/they!"
                  - "Uhh, there is a third one, but my lawyers have advised me not to tell you."
              - hg[Variant 10]: "Psst, hey! Wanna learn the secret to free rep?"
                  - hg[Option 1]: Can you tell me more?
                    - (Archived)
                      - "Well... Basically, when you hang out with your friends for like, an hour, you can both earn some driver and passenger rep..." 
                      - "You can get rewarded for up to three friends a day. You earn 10 driver rep for the first friend, and 5 driver rep for the other two. You get 10 passenger rep every time, though~"
                      - "The friends you invite get 10 driver and passenger rep as well. Neat, right?"
                      - "And since you can do this every day, according to my calculations, that means... hg[uhh, carry the two.. and...]"
                      - "MEOW! That's like, 200 reputations a week or something??"
                    - (Current)
                      - "Well... Basically, when you hang out with your friends for like, an hour, you can both earn coins alongside some driver and passenger rep..."

                      - "The friends you invite get 300 coins, plus 10 driver rep and passenger rep as well. Neat, right?"
                      - "And since you can do this every day, according to my calculations, that means... hg[uhh, carry the two.. and...]"
                      - "MEOW! That's like, 4,000 coins and 200 reputations a week or something??"
                    - "So... You interested?"
                     - hg[Option 1]: I'm in!
                        - "Pawsome~ Just tell me who to call!!"
                          - (An Invite Friends prompt appears.)
                     - hg[Option 2]: Nah.
                        - "Alright! If you ever change your mind, you know who to call."
                  - hg[Option 2]: Sounds good to me!
                      - "Pawsome~ Just tell me who to call!!"
                          - (An Invite Friends prompt appears.)
                  - hg[Option 3]: I have no friends.
                      - "Oh. Uhm, yeowch... Didn't mean to rub salt in the wound, there... Hope you find some soon...?"
                  - hg[Option 4]: Nah.
                      - "Alright! If you ever change your mind, you know who to call."
              - hg[Variant 11]: "You should play Kit Battle! It's a pretty great game in my honest opinion..."
                  - hg[Option 1]: I will play it right now.
                      - "Good, have fun~!"
                          - (The game will teleport you to Kit Battle.)
                  - hg[Option 2]: Is this sponsored?
                      - "Totally not!! I would never take money to advertise a game..."
                      - "You definitely should play Kit Battle though..."
                  - hg[Option 3]: Did you just-?
                      - ...no?
                      - (If the player's account age is 12 or younger \[<12\], this dialogue plays instead.)
                          - "Hey, you should pl-- Oh, uhm..."
                              - hg[Option 1]: I'll just go.
                              - hg[Option 2]: ...? What's up?
                                  - "S-Sorry, looks like I'm getting a call! Please hold..."
                                  - "Meowdy, Pear speaking~!"
                                  - "Uh-huh... uh-huh...oh, excuse me, could you repeat that..?"
                                  - "oh, shoot... on god? they're a...?"
                                  - "okay, thank you so much for letting me know... talk to you later, meow~!"
                                  - "Um, uh, heeeey, you!"
                                      - hg[Option 1]: What was that about?
                                          - "Um, nothing! I've gotta go now, see ya!!!"
                                      - hg[Option 2]: Um.. hi..?
                                          - "Yooo, you're talkin' to me? Brand new conversation, with me?! That's crazy! We should talk about how..."
                                              - (Pear then chooses a random dialogue line.)
              - hg[Variant 12]
                  - "It's pretty nice out today, wouldn't you agree?"
                      - hg[Option 1]: Yeah. 
                          - "Yeah~"
                      - hg[Option 2]: Nah. 
                          - "Agree to disagree~"
              - hg[Variant 13]
                  - My favorite drink is Vanilla Almond Milk!
                      - "Although... I wonder what a shield potion tastes like..."
              - hg[Variant 14] (during Bus Simulator's 5th birthday):

                      - "Hey, you look cold. Want a warm drink?"
                          - hg[Option 1]: Yeah. 
                              - "Here, take one. I made a bunch a while back. I wonder how they're still warm..?" 
                                - (The player then obtains the [Hot Chocolate](hot-chocolate).)
                          - hg[Option 2]: Nah. 
                              - "Suit yourself."
                  - If the player already possesses the [Hot Chocolate](hot-chocolate) item:

              - hg[Variant 17]:
                - "Do you play.. err, that rhythm game that has a racing game, survival game, and battle royale game attached to it? I do.. sometimes. I think."
              - hg[Variant 18]:
                - "Honestly, could go for a graham cracker right now..."
              - hg[Variant 19]:
                - "Are you wondering why my seat looks different from the rest?"
                  - hg[Option 1]: Yeah, what's with that?
                    - "Well, I was sitting in my usual spot, when all of a sudden some people came aboard, talking about renovations..."
                    - "And well, that's cool and all, but what about my seat? I didn't want to change my seat... We've made so many memories together..."
                    - "So I straight up just asked if I could keep it, and funnily enough they actually let me. They moved me to the corner to clear out some space but whatever. As long as I got to keep the seat, it's all *purr*fect to me!"
                    - "But yeah, I guess the moral of the story is to not be afraid to ask about stuff? The worst they could say is no, after all..."
                  - hg[Option 2]: No, not really.
                    - "Oh, then I'll spare you the details."
   - hg[Option 3]: Invites...
        - "Oh? What about them?" 
          - hg[Option 1]: Let's send some! 
            - "Quite the social butterfly~ Sure, I can do that for you!"

              - "The friends you invite get 10 driver and passenger rep as well. Neat, right?"
              - "And since you can do this every day, according to my calculations, that means... hg[uhh, carry the two.. and...]"
              - "MEOW! That's like, 200 reputations a week or something??"
            - (Current)

              - "MEOW! That's like, 4,000 coins and 200 reputations a week or something??"
            - "So... You interested?"
             - hg[Option 1]: I'm in!
               - "Pawsome~ Just tell me who to call!!"
                  - (An Invite Friends prompt appears.)
              - hg[Option 2]: Nah.
                - "Alright! If you ever change your mind, you know who to call."
           - hg[Option 3]: Nevermind.
            - "If you change your mind, you know who to call."
      - hg[Option 4]: Buy Songs
          - "You sure you wanna buy songs for everyone in the server? It's a little useless after... The Incident..."
              - hg[Option 1]: Uhm, nevermind...
                  - "Yeah, thought so~"
              - hg[Option 2]: Yeah, I'm sure.

          - "Oh, sure! Use that mirror of yours and we can start!"

  ##[**The Bus (Billy)**]
  !!DLEMULATOR EID:"billy_pearemulator" SID:"start_billy" URL:"/assets/bussim/emulatorData/pear.json"

  - Pear chooses any Intro Variants
  - "..."
    - hg[Variant 1]: "You trying to take over the comment section or something?"
    - hg[Variant 2]: "I don't care who Billy sends, I'm not copy and pasting him..."

   ###[Animal Messenger Quest-Line]
  This quest-line starts from [Frostbite](frostbite)'s Option 2, 3, 1, 2 and assuming the player hasn't completed it already. Pear's dialogue will also be added here and vice-versa. You'll also need the Part of the Pack badge and be friends with [Frost](frostbite) to activate.

  ###[Part 1 (Frost)]
  ###[First Time Dialogue:]
  - "Listen. If you ever see Pear again, I'd really appreciate it if you sent him my regards. Let that little rascal know I'm still around."
    - hg[Yeah, sure. I will.]
      - "Thanks. I'd do it myself, but I've just got no clue where he is..."

  ###[If you haven't sent his regards yet]
  - "I've already told you all this before, but again, I'd really appreciate it if you sent him my regards."
    - hg[I'll do it eventually.]
      - "Thanks..."

  ###[Part 2 (Pear)]
  - Frost sends his regards.
    - "What?! Really?!"
    - "Daaaang! I haven't seen Frost in forrrrr-everrrrrr, did you actually find him?"
    - "That's crazy! Can you do me a favor and tell him I said hi back? I'm sure he'd be happy to hear!"
    - "Oh, and if he doesn't believe you, just say I called him a good boy. He's actually a real big softie, but I think I'm the only person he's really opened up to?"
    - "Don't tell him that, or he'll probably bite me the next time he sees me. Anyway, good luck!~"

  ###[Part 3 (Frost)]
  - Pear says "hi" back.
    - "Well I'll be, did they really? Do they actually remember me after all this time?"
      - hg[Option 1]: Yeah, and they called you a good boy.
        - "..!"
        - "..."
        - "Yeah, uhm, definitely sounds like him.. I believe ya.."
        - "Um, uh.. Thanks.. I never thought I'd be able to talk to him again.. And I'm glad he, uh.. still thinks highly of me..."
        - "!"
        - "Pretend that none of this <big>EVER</big> happened!"
      - hg[Option 2]: Yeah, they do.
        - "I find that a little hard to believe, but.. Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk to him again, even though it was more of a.. relayed message, heh.."

  ###[Part 4 (Pear)]
  For this part, you'll have to shuffle through Pear's "Let's Talk" Dialogue until you get the h[Tub of Ice Cream] topic.

  ###[First Time Dialogue]
  - "Tell Frost he owes me a tub of ice cream next time he sees me..."
  - "No reason in particular, I just want one!"
    - hg[Yeah, sure. I'll tell him.]
      - "Well, I mean, I was kinda half joking, but thanks! Maybe I'll get that ice cream after all..~"

  ###[If you haven't sent his message yet]
  - "Tell Frost he owes me a tub of ice cream next time he sees me..."
  - "No reason in particular, I just want one!"
    - hg[I'll get to it eventually.]
      - "Thanks~"

  ###[If you had sent his message but not directly told him after Part 5]
  - "Tell Frost he owes me a tub of ice cream next time he sees me..."
  - "No reason in particular, I just want one!"
    - hg[I told him.]
      - "Whuh?! You actually did?!"
      - "Thank you.. I've been wanting to tell him that for years!" (Triggers the Animal Messenger Badge)

  ###[Part 5 (Frost)]
  - Pear wanted to say...
    - "Pfft, a whole tub of ice cream?"
    - "I mean, it's definitely been some time since I've made any ice cream, but.. I'd definitely try for him!"
    - "We'd have to find a place to meet up... And I'd have to buy the ingredients... I could make that recipe for him, finally.."
    - "You could have some too, if you'd like. Pear always said that I'd made the best ice cream they've ever tasted.."
    - "I mean, I don't know about that, but I could be convinced of it... Ice wolf, after all."
    - "Anyway, enough about that. Thanks for relaying the message! I'll have to think about it later, heh"

  ###[Part 6 (Pear)]
  This part will give you the Animal Messenger badge upon completion- but there is one more part left!

  - Told Frost about the ice cream.
    - "Whuh?! You actually did?!"
    - "Thank you.. I've been wanting to tell him that for years!" (Triggers the Animal Messenger Badge)

  ###[Finale (Frost)]
  This part occurs as soon as you re-enter Frost's den following Pear's response.
  - hg[Variant 1]: "[Player], hey!"
  - hg[Variant 2]: "Oh, hey [Player]!"
  - "I, uh, just wanted to say thank you. For everything."
  - "I like to keep things short and sweet, so here. Catch!"
    - You: "<You grab the object he tosses at you. Looks like a handheld mirror of some sort.>"
      - "If ya ever feel lonely, or just want a safe space to chill, feel free to come back anytime."
      - "Alright, see ya on the flip side."

  ###[Drink Responses (The Bus)]
  - If you give Pear the wrong drink:
    - "Oh, is that drink for me? Thanks!"
  - If you give Pear <clr:#151812>(***The Sludge.***):
    - "Wh... WHAT is that???"
    - "Uh... yeah... thank you?"
    - "I'll... uh... drink that... later... haha... when you walk away... totally..."
    - "..."
      - Pear then throws out <clr:#151812>(***The Sludge.***)
  - If you give Pear <clr:#FFF5EB>(***Vanilla Almond Milk***):
    - "Oh? Is that for me????"
    - "Thank you!! That's my favorite drink..."
      - This dialogue repeats even with another favorite drink.

        - "Oh? What about them?" 
          - hg[Option 1]: Let's send some! 
            - "Quite the social butterfly~ Sure, I can do that for you!"

              - "And since you can do this every day, according to my calculations, that means... hg[uhh, carry the two.. and...]"

                  - An Invite Friends prompt appears.

  ###[Drink Responses (Pear Takes The Wheel)]
  - If you give Pear the wrong drink:
    - "No thanks, I'm driving."
  - If you give Pear <clr:#151812>(***The Sludge.***):
    - "Wh... WHAT is that???"
    - "Are you *trying* to get us killed?!"
    - "Really trying to offer me a cup of eldritch horrors while I'm driving... Okay man..."
    - Pear throws out <clr:#151812>(***The Sludge.***)
  - If you give Pear <clr:#FFF5EB>(***Vanilla Almond Milk***):
    - "Vanilla Almond Milk? While I'm driving???"
    - "Fine, I guess... But only because it's my favorite!!"
      - This dialogue repeats even with another favorite drink.
      
  ###[Airhorn Responses (The Bus & Pear Takes The Wheel)]
  - If the airhorn is used repeatedly in proximity to Pear:
    - "MMEEEOOOOOWWWWWWWW!!!!!"
    - "You. Scramble like an egg, before I fold you like an omelette."
  - If the airhorn is used repeatedly in proximity to Pear a second time and so on:
    - "MMEEEOOOOOWWWWWWWW!!!!!"
    - <25px>(<clr:#ff0000>("DIE."))
      - (The player is then killed.)
      - The entire response is then repeated afterwards.

        - hg[Option 1]: Are you the real Pear?
          - "Duh?"
            - hg[Option 1]: Good enough for me.

I also saw a dark-looking one, but I didn't interact with it, just being near it gave me the creeps... I wouldn't drink that if I were you-- but if you do, try and be a bit careful maybe?"
        - hg[Variant 2]: "There was some black goo on the floor, and I accidentally got some of it on my paws... Uh, don't do that. It felt like my insides were melting away... Thankfully, I still had a sip of Almond Water left!"
        - hg[Variant 3]: "The entities around here are kinda scary... I tried to hide away in a room when one spotted me, but it still knew where I was..! I guess they can still track you for a bit when you're out of sight..."
        - hg[Variant 4]: "The Backwalls are a bit daunting.. It seems like every time I end up down here, the whole layout changes! Thankfully, one thing is always constant--the exit! There's no neon signs pointing right to it or anything, but you should look for a green ceiling light! It seems like it's never turned off, and it's always right by the exit!"
        - hg[Variant 5]: "mmrroww? Why'd I call it the Backwalls..? Don't know, I just made up a name for the third time I ended up here! Just felt right, ya know?"
        - hg[Variant 6]: "Once, I saw some kinda image-looking thing at the end of a hallway. It didn't look like the ones I'm used to. I didn't get any closer to it, and I never saw it again. Guess we'll never know. <small>I'm just glad it wasn't quandale again...</small>"
        - hg[Variant 7]: "Try not to die out there~"
        - hg[Variant 8]: "Uhm, thanks for listening to me ramble..! I'm kinda out of stuff to say, so I'll just start repeating myself from here on out.. Feel free to leave now if you want." (after all variants 1-7 have been seen)

  ###[**The Backwalls (After Paying)**]
  - hg[Variant 1]: "Here we go, on a dangerous journey to the exit!"
  - hg[Variant 2]: "Alright, you've paid up! Just follow my lead! Watch for entities, though."
  - hg[Variant 3]: "This cat'll take you right to where you need to be!
  - hg[Variant 4]: "Come with me, and you'll see, a hole of pure illumination!"
  - hg[Variant 5]: "Don't need to worry about me, I'm too powerful for the entities. You aren't, though."

  ###[**The Backwalls (Entity Encounter)**]
  - hg[Variant 1]: "Hello, I'm currently leading someone away from you. If you'd be so kind as to keep them alive, that'd be great."
  - hg[Variant 2]: "Pardon me, I'm just attempting to bring this player with me to the exit. Remain calm, I do not wish to disturb you."
  - hg[Variant 3]: "Hi, my name is Pear Paw. I'm crossing paths with you on business terms. Please keep me and my client in one piece."
  - hg[Variant 4]: "Excuse me, I have a client with me. It'd be nice of you to hold your aggro for a lil bit."

  ###[**The Backwalls (Puddle Encounter)**]
  - "Don't worry about me. I can't die from this, I'm too powerful."

  ###[**The Backwalls (Player Encounter)***]
  - hg[Variant 1]: "Hello there, new person! Just letting you know, I'm only responsible for my client back there. Join at your own risk!"
  - hg[Variant 2]: "Ah, hello there. Planning on joining us? I'm legally obliged to let you know that you won't be protected by me in case of an entity attack."
  - hg[Variant 3]: "Hello! If you're gonna follow us, just know that I'm not legally responsible for anything that happens to you!"

  ###[**The Backwalls (Client Dies)***]
  - "Good game, I guess."

  ###[**The Backwalls (If the player stopped moving / is too far behind)**]
  - hg[Variant 1]: "Hey..! Stay close!"
  - hg[Variant 2]: "Hey, did you just pay me to be nice, or are you gonna actually follow me?"
  - hg[Variant 3]: "mmrow? Hey, get moving!"
  - hg[Variant 4]: "Alright. I'll stop and wait."
  - hg[Variant 5]: "What are you standing around for? It's dangerous out here!"
    - (Continuing from all variations, Pear will stop moving for a bit and waits for the player.)

  ###[**The Backwalls (If the player actively heads in the wrong path)**] 
  - hg[Variant 1]: "W-Whuh?! Where are you going..?!"
  - hg[Variant 2]; "Wrong way, dummy! What the heck??"
    - (Continuing from all variations, Pear will actively move to the player, speeding up and stops moving upon reuniting. )
    - After Pear is reunited with the player: 
      - hg[Variant 1]: "Why'd you wander off like that..?! Give me another second to think.."
      - hg[Variant 2]: "What the heck.. why..? Now we're off course.."
      - hg[Variant 3]: "Sheesh.. giving me a heart attack.. Now I gotta rethink our path.."
        - (Continuing from all variations, Pear then resumes his path.)

  ###[**The Backwalls (If the Pathfinding takes a while)**]
  - "Yeah sorry, it's really far away. I really do know where it is though, trust!"
    - "Just a little longer. Hang in there." (If it takes a while...)
      - "Dang, my legs are getting tired..." (If it takes a good while...) 
        - "Fun walking simulator." (If it takes a very long while...)
          - "This is just like Plural Life..." (If it takes an absurdly long while...)

  ###[**The Backwalls (Exit Arrival)**]
  - hg[Variant 1]: "Here's the exit hole! That wasn't too bad, was it?"
  - hg[Variant 2]: "Tadaaaa, here we are at the exit! Thanks again for the rep~"
  - hg[Variant 3]: "We made it in one pieece! I mean, I would have made it either way, but you were totally a liability!"
  - hg[Variant 4]: "Jump through this hole and you'll be back in no time~"
    - Continuation (after any variant):
      - hg[Variant 1]: "Alright then, see you later!"
      - hg[Variant 2]: "Hope you're satisfied! I'm just gonna do my own thing now." 
      - hg[Variant 3]: "Thanks for your patronage~! I'm gonna search for more customers."

  ###[**The Backwalls (If the direct path to the exit fails)**]
  - hg[Variant 1]: "E-ehm... J-Just.. give me a second..." 
  - hg[Variant 2]: "U-Uhh, h-hang on, I need some time to remember where to go..."
    - (In all variations will Pear attempt to pathfind to the closest spot nearest to the Escape room, if possible.)
    - If the pathfind check succeeds:
      - hg[Variant 1]: "I'll try my best to get there, but it's not gonna be super accurate, okay?"
      - hg[Variant 2]: "Uh, I couldn't remember the direct path. I'll get you somewhere nearby though. Sorry."
        - Once Pear finds the closest spot to the exit:
          - hg[Variant 1]: "This is as close as I'm able to get.. Good luck.."
          - hg[Variant 2]: "Here's.. the exit... I think...?"
    - If the pathfind check fails:
      - hg[Variant 1]: "...You're not gonna like what I'm say but... I can't remember the path. See ya!"
      - hg[Variant 2]: "S-Sike, you're never getting out of here! Thanks for the rep..! Haha.. ha.." (Archived)
      - hg[Variant 2]: "S-Sike, you're never getting out of here! Thanks for the coins..! Haha.. ha.." (Archived)
        - (Pear then disappears with green smoke.)

  ##[Trivia]
  - He is the only NPC that offers you something in exchange for Robux.\n\n
  - Pear can also be seen in the Backwalls event, wandering around.\n\n
  - Pear will still get annoyed at you (and afterwards, kills you) if you use the Airhorn while not on the same floor as him, but at a similar horizontal area, such as the seat directly below and above him.\n\n
  - If the private server owner uses the !seats command, Pear will stand in place instead.\n\n
  - Pear's calculations with the invite system is partially accurate, as you actually gain up to 1,100 Coins, 20 Driver Reputation and 30 Passenger Reputation per day, up to 7,700 Coins, 140 Driver Reputation and 210 Passenger Reputation every week, for a total of 350 Reputation. This is only including inviting your friends, and not the other way around.\n\n
  - Using a Gear that causes fatality on Pear will cause him to 'counter', instakilling everyone near him.
    - This is an anticheat made to prevent [Pear Takes The Wheel](pear-takes-the-wheel) from being softlocked.\n\n
  - Pear's fourth variant in arriving at the exit is a direct reference to [Pure Imagination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVi3-PrQ0pY), a song composed by Gene Wilder for Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory.\n\n 
  - Pear's 5th dialogue if it takes an absurdly long time to reach to the exit is a direct reference to [Second Life](https://secondlife.com/).
