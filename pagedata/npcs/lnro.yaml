  lnro is an NPC that appears in the [Sparkplug Cafe](cafe) event. They are also a developer for Bus Simulator.

  ##[Dialogue]
  There is currently no available emulator for lnro.
  ###[Cafe (Intro)]
  - "Oh-! I'll be there in a bit, please wait patiently up front!"
    - hg[Option 1A]: Have you seen a mechanic around here?
      - "Seen a mechanic? I *am* a mechanic."
      - "I'm gonna be busy with the cafe all day though. None of my employees came in today, so it's just me..."
        - hg[Option 1]: I can fill in.
          - "Oh! That'd be really helpful, actually."
          - "How about this: you take care of the customers, serve them and make their drinks, and I'll go out and fix your bus. Deal?"
            - hg[Option 1]: Actually...
              - "Oh, no, don't worry, I understand. You're the customer... I shouldn't have you doing my job."
            - hg[Option 2]: Deal.
              - "Okay, awesome."
              - "I'll get to it then, so you should to!" 
                - Following this will start the minigame.
        - hg[Option 1]: Unfortunate!
    - hg[Option 1B]: Us again. (Replaces Option 1; Available if the player has started and finished the minigame earlier today.)
      - "Oh, right. Hey. Same deal?"
      - "I'll get to it then, you know what to do."
        - Following this will start the minigame.
    - hg[Option 2]: Okay.

  ###[**Cafe (Idle, if no players started the minigame for a while; around 3 minutes)**]
  - "That bus has been out there for a while now..." <small>(This is said on the Roblox Chat)</small>
  - "Hey um, can you move? You're taking up all of the parking space.. I don't think my customers can get in like this."
    - You: "We can't."
      - "What? Is that bus broken down..?"
      - "*sigh*... I guess i can fix it for you. But you're gonna have to leave once I'm done. <12px>(hg[I'm already being stretched thin as-is..])"
        - After a while...
          - "It's all fixed up now. Be on your way."
  
  ###[**Cafe (Evaluation)**]
  - If the players have <clr:#45ff45>(successfully) provided almost all of the customers with the correct order:
    - MLG: "Huh. You did better than I thought you would."
    - MLG: "Nice job. She put the cafe in good hands, I guess. You'll probably get some compensation for your time."
      - "Whew! That bus should be up and running again." 
      - "Before you go, I just wanted to say thanks. Fixing that bus felt like a break for me, I'm feeling ready to take the next day head-on!"
      - "Oh, and since you were kind of an employee, I might as well pay you something. Take **120** coins and **5-8** passenger rep as compensation."
      - "I hope to see you again soon! Hopefully without being stranded."
  - If the players have <clr:#ff0000>(failed) to provide almost all of the customers with the correct order:
    - MLG: "Wow. That was pretty lousy."
    - MLG: "What, you thought I wouldn't notice? I'm still half paying attention to you, you know."
    - MLG: "I'm not sure lnro's gonna be too happy after that performance."
      - "Hey! The bus should be up and running again." 
      - "Oh, and by the way..."
      - "My phone was blowing up while I was fixing the bus... What did you do?"
      - "I really hope my ratings haven't dropped too much..."
