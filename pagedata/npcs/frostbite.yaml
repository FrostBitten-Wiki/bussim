  ##[Info]
  Frostbite (or known as Frost in-game) is an NPC that only appears in the [Glacier Cave](glacier-cave) event.
  As soon as you enter his den for the first time, Frost will be surprised at your arrival,
  however he allows you to explore his den but without your trust.
  \n\n
  It is known that Frost is a childhood friend of Pear, which may come fruitful in the two methods to obtain badges.

  ##[Favourite Drink]
  Frostbite's favourite drink is [The Blizzard](cafe-coffee-recipes). This gives you either 4 Passenger Rep or 4 Driver Rep.

  ##[Trust]
  Frost has a unique mechanic compared to most NPCs,
  where he has different dialogue based on his trust level which goes from 0 to 2 at max.
  In order to fully gain Frost's trust, you can give him an [Ice Cream](ice-cream) and [Pearcoin^(TM)](pearcoin) to make him trust you 
  Or by giving him the Spronkbib Popsicle.
  \n\n
  The latter choice is locked if you decide to give him Ice Cream instead.
  \n\n
  Maxing out his trust by offering the [Spronkbib Popsicle](spronkbib-popsicle) (or showing [pearcoin^(TM)](pearcoin) following the [Ice Cream](ice-cream)) will give you a badge [Part of the Pack](https://www.roblox.com/badges/2130010648/Part-of-the-Pack), 
  and is necessary to unlock the second one. His dialogue and choices also change afterwards.
  \n\n
  Certain items can also be offered, however they don't provide any trust such as [Gas Station Ice Cream](gas-station-ice-cream) and [Birthday Ice Cream](birthday-ice-cream).

                  - "Flatted, but I don't really know you too well."

                                  - "Yep. If I ever saw them again, I'd be the happiest wolf in the world. Don't exactly know where he ran off to, though.. No scent or anything..."
                              - hg[Option 2]: Sounds terrifying.
                                  - "Heh, it was rather cute, actually. He's so small that he could barely wrap his mouth around the corner of one. Meanwhile, here I am, able to bite the whole thing in one go.."

                      - hg[Option 2]: Why do you live in a cave?
                          - "The economy is terrible. I just found this cave and decided to live here."

                                                - The player then obtains the [Frozen Chocolate](frozen-chocolate).

                              - hg[Option 5]: Why do you live in a cave?
                                  - "I'll be completely honest with ya, I couldn't afford anything else. I was gonna live in that free-model town, y'know, the one with the [gas station](goat-station), but I couldn't afford the rent..."
                                      - hg[Option 1]: Living in a cave is cooler anyway.
                                          - "Mm, maybe that's true... After all, I do have lots more space than an actual house.. A free pool, too.. Yeah, I like that way of thinkin'. This IS way cooler than a house."
                                      - hg[Option 2]: Isn't the rent there pretty low?
                                          - "Yeah, but I still didn't have enough for it... Maybe in the future, I'll make some kinda company or somethin'... I don't know what I'd do though, maybe somethin' ice-cream related?"
                                              - hg[Option 1]: In today's economy? Good luck...
                                                  - "Yeah, you're right... It'd be probably be tough to get a business up and runnin' nowadays, huh? Maybe I should just give it up..."

                                                                  - "-sigh-"
                                              - hg[Option 2]: I'm rooting for you, Frost!
                                                  - "Thanks.. I don't remember the last time someone's actually believed in me before.. I'll try my best, (player), just you wait!"
                                              - hg[Option 3]: Ouch, sorry..
                                                  - "Eh, no need to be sorry. You didn't do anything wrong. Life just sucks sometimes. The most important thing is that I got through it. I'm pretty cozy where I am now, even if it's not really a proper home."

  ###[Animal Messenger Quest-Line]
  This quest-line starts from [Frostbite](frostbite)'s Option 2, 3, 1, 2 and assuming the player hasn't completed it already. Pear's dialogue will also be added here and vice-versa. You'll also need the Part of the Pack badge and be friends with [Frost](frostbite) to activate.

  ###[Part 1 (Frost)]
  ###[First Time Dialogue:]
  - "Listen. If you ever see Pear again, I'd really appreciate it if you sent him my regards. Let that little rascal know I'm still around."
    - hg[Yeah, sure. I will.]
      - "Thanks. I'd do it myself, but I've just got no clue where he is..."

  ###[If you haven't sent his regards yet]
  - "I've already told you all this before, but again, I'd really appreciate it if you sent him my regards."
    - hg[I'll do it eventually.]
      - "Thanks..."

  ###[Part 2 (Pear)]
  - Frost sends his regards.
    - "What?! Really?!"
    - "Daaaang! I haven't seen Frost in forrrrr-everrrrrr, did you actually find him?"
    - "That's crazy! Can you do me a favor and tell him I said hi back? I'm sure he'd be happy to hear!"
    - "Oh, and if he doesn't believe you, just say I called him a good boy. He's actually a real big softie, but I think I'm the only person he's really opened up to?"
    - "Don't tell him that, or he'll probably bite me the next time he sees me. Anyway, good luck!~"

  ###[Part 3 (Frost)]
  - Pear says "hi" back.
    - "Well I'll be, did they really? Do they actually remember me after all this time?"
      - hg[Option 1]: Yeah, and they called you a good boy.
        - "..!"
        - "..."
        - "Yeah, uhm, definitely sounds like him.. I believe ya.."
        - "Um, uh.. Thanks.. I never thought I'd be able to talk to him again.. And I'm glad he, uh.. still thinks highly of me..."
        - "!"
        - "Pretend that none of this <big>EVER</big> happened!"
      - hg[Option 2]: Yeah, they do.
        - "I find that a little hard to believe, but.. Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk to him again, even though it was more of a.. relayed message, heh.."

  ###[Part 4 (Pear)]
  For this part, you'll have to shuffle through Pear's "Let's Talk" Dialogue until you get the h[Tub of Ice Cream] topic.

  ###[First Time Dialogue]
  - "Tell Frost he owes me a tub of ice cream next time he sees me..."
  - "No reason in particular, I just want one!"
    - hg[Yeah, sure. I'll tell him.]
      - "Well, I mean, I was kinda half joking, but thanks! Maybe I'll get that ice cream after all..~"

  ###[If you haven't sent his message yet]
  - "Tell Frost he owes me a tub of ice cream next time he sees me..."
  - "No reason in particular, I just want one!"
    - hg[I'll get to it eventually.]
      - "Thanks~"

  ###[If you had sent his message but not directly told him after Part 5]
  - "Tell Frost he owes me a tub of ice cream next time he sees me..."
  - "No reason in particular, I just want one!"
    - hg[I told him.]
      - "Whuh?! You actually did?!"
      - "Thank you.. I've been wanting to tell him that for years!" (Triggers the Animal Messenger Badge)

  ###[Part 5 (Frost)]
  - Pear wanted to say...
    - "Pfft, a whole tub of ice cream?"
    - "I mean, it's definitely been some time since I've made any ice cream, but.. I'd definitely try for him!"
    - "We'd have to find a place to meet up... And I'd have to buy the ingredients... I could make that recipe for him, finally.."
    - "You could have some too, if you'd like. Pear always said that I'd made the best ice cream they've ever tasted.."
    - "I mean, I don't know about that, but I could be convinced of it... Ice wolf, after all."
    - "Anyway, enough about that. Thanks for relaying the message! I'll have to think about it later, heh"

  ###[Part 6 (Pear)]
  This part will give you the Animal Messenger badge upon completion- but there is one more part left!

  - Told Frost about the ice cream.
    - "Whuh?! You actually did?!"
    - "Thank you.. I've been wanting to tell him that for years!" (Triggers the Animal Messenger Badge)

  ###[Finale (Frost)]
  This part occurs as soon as you re-enter Frost's den following Pear's response.
  - hg[Variant 1]: "<Player>, hey!"
  - hg[Variant 2]: "Oh, hey <Player>!"
  - "I, uh, just wanted to say thank you. For everything."
  - "I like to keep things short and sweet, so here. Catch!"
    - You: "<You grab the object he tosses at you. Looks like a handheld mirror of some sort.>"
      - "If ya ever feel lonely, or just want a safe space to chill, feel free to come back anytime."
      - "Alright, see ya on the flip side."

  ###[Drink Responses]
  - If you give Frost the wrong drink:
    - "Oh, that's for me..?"
    - "..." 
    - "Uh... Interesting..."
    - "Thanks for that, I guess..? Don't think I'd choose to drink that myself, though..."
  - If you give Frost <clr:#151812>(***The Sludge.***):
    - "Uh- WOAH... That smells awful."
    - "A little word of advice, I don't think ya should drink that..?"
    - "What even *is* it? Why is it in a cup?"
    - "Either way, get rid of it... And preferably do it somewhere further away."
  - If you give Frost <clr:#C7FFFF>(***The Blizzard***):
    - "Oh, that's for me..?"
    - "Brrrrrrrr, that's *COLD*..."
    - "Just the way I like it, heh. Thanks for the drink."
      - If you given him another <clr:#C7FFFF>(***The Blizzard***):
        - "Oh, that's for me..?"
         - "Brrrrrrrr, that's *COLD*..."
        - "Just the way I like it, heh. Thanks for the drink."

  ##[Trivia]
  - Frost is [NobleReign](noble) fursona.
      - Despite this, both Noble and Frost don't know each other and isn't referenced in any of their dialogues.
  - Frost is also a childhood friend of Pear, which is referenced in a few of his dialogue.
  - Frost is referenced by multiple news shouts about stealing [Spronkbib Popsicles](spronkbib-popsicle), rendering the popsicles a rarity now. This is alluded to the fact that the chances of getting one from an Ice Cream Truck is extremely rare.
  - If you bought pearcoin^(TM) in the server without rejoining, you need to rejoin to be able to use it however [Pear's](pear) dialogue will change without rejoin needed.
  - If you offered Frost a [Spronkbib Popsicle](spronkbib-popsicle) instead of the [Ice Cream](ice-cream) + [PearcoinTM](pearcoin) duo, he will still mention about receiving a PearcoinTM from you, despite not possibly even owning one nor showing it to Frost in the first place.
  - If you really don't want to spend any Robux, the best way to get Frost's trust is to get the legendary [Spronkbib Popsicle](spronkbib-popsicle), which has a 1/800 chance of getting, or by giving him multiple [Ice Creams](ice-cream).
      - The latter is still not confirmed yet.

  ##[Technical Trivia]
  - Frostbite has a unique folder inside called TrustLevels which determines what dialogue he uses to the player depending on the player's trust. It comes with 4 levels, Acquainted (1), Friends (2), Stranger (0), and Intruder (First Introductions)
    - He also has TrustLevels_Airhorn which has all 4 subfolders similar to TrustLevels, but ideally has different dialogue based on your current trust with Frost.
