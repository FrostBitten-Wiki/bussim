                  - "Ah... I should stop before I ramble on for too long, sorry. I tend to ramble when i get excited..."
                - hg[Option 2]: Functionally. What do. You DO?
                  - "I don't get why you would ask that, I'm just sitting here minding my business, and that's such a weird thing to ask a person... Can you leave me alone please?"
                - hg[Option 3]: Ah just... Nevermind.

          - hg[Variant 5]: "Don't be ashamed to enjoy things publicly! No matter how nerdy or dorky you might feel when expressing yourself, it's way more fun to be you in the ways that you enjoy!"\n\n
          - hg[Variant 6]: "It's ok to do things the easy way sometimes, taking shortcuts every now and again is fine as long as taking them isn't detrimental to learning and becoming better."\n\n
          - hg[Variant 7]: "You can use rocks to set off dart traps, so don't feel the need to continuously jump into them! Try being more clever with your strategies!"\n\n

          - hg[Variant 10]: "Diets are important to maintain, make sure that you eat at least a good chunk of moderately healthy food! Treating yourself can be nice, but if you eat out commonly that can really be bad for you."\n\n
          - hg[Variant 11]: "When doing projects and schoolwork, make sure to take a minute to pause every now and again. Typically I tend to do 30 minutes to an hour of relaxing after putting in a lot of effort for my work, though it may work differently for you."\n\n
          - hg[Variant 12]: "It's important to head to the clock tower to reset the clock after kicking everyone out of the system. Do that and you can achieve functional immortality through the voidway!"\n\n

          - hg[Variant 16]: "I don't know if that bus is taking you where you need to go... if you need to get somewhere quick, I'd tell you to get a cab, but it seems all cars are broken..."\n\n
          - hg[Variant 17]: "Oh! Make sure to make some good pals every now and again, talking to people can be really nice sometimes. It's nice to have a friend!"\n\n
          - hg[Variant 18]: "If she regularly eats at jack in the box, she's for the streets. Remember, licking doorknobs is illegal on other planets!"\n\n
          - hg[Variant 19]: "Don't forget that demons hate the scent of rosemary!"\n\n
          - hg[Variant 20]: "If you ever feel a little lost, try picking up a soothing hobby! Maybe something nice like collecting things could be engaging and fun for you! Personally, I like collecting dice! I think they're fun to pick up and roll around and also they're super pretty!"\n\n
          - hg[Variant 21]: "Don't let other people determine your own self-worth. You're your own person, and it's important to not evaluate yourself from the lens of others, but from yourself! Think of it like... not comparing yourself to someone better than you, but comparing yourself to how you used to be, it helps you improve!"\n\n
          - hg[Variant 22]: "Grass beats water, Water beats fire, and fire beats grass! It's a simple set of rules, it's basically just rock paper scissors, but learning the match-ups is important!"\n\n
          - hg[Variant 23]: "Not everything you do has to be a masterpiece! Sometimes you can do only pretty good instead of perfect, and that's ok! Sometimes you might even grow past your masterpiece, which is great and shows you've improved!"\n\n

          - hg[Variant 26]: "When attempting to do a cassoosted fuper, make sure not to buffer your dash too early, else you won't perform your super on queue!"\n\n
          - hg[Variant 27]: "Non-disclosure agreements, or NDAs, are contracts that prevent people from discussing certain topics, typically used for actors and people who work in the media. There are loopholes to them though, if you read them closely you might be able to leak facts early, like a game's existence!"
            - hg[Option 1]: Another tip, please.
              - (The dialogue refreshes to a new Variant.)
            - hg[Option 2]: Thanks.
              - "I hope a tip stood out to you!"
    - hg[Option 2]: Cool bottle.
      - "Oh gosh, thanks! I'm proud to be who I am today, and i wear this bottle with all my pride!"\n\n
