          - hg[Variant 11]: "When doing projects and schoolwork, make sure to take a minute to pause every now and again. Typically I tend to do 30 minutes to an hour of relaxing after putting in a lot of effort for my work, though it may work differently for you."\n\n
          - hg[Variant 12]: "It's important to head to the clock tower to reset the clock after kicking everyone out of the system. Do that and you can achieve functional immortality through the voidway!"\n\n

          - hg[Variant 18]: "If she regularly eats at jack in the box, she's for the streets. Remember, licking doorknobs is illegal on other planets!"\n\n
          - hg[Variant 19]: "Don't forget that demons hate the scent of rosemary!"\n\n
          - hg[Variant 20]: "If you ever feel a little lost, try picking up a soothing hobby! Maybe something nice like collecting things could be engaging and fun for you! Personally, I like collecting dice! I think they're fun to pick up and roll around and also they're super pretty!"\n\n
          - hg[Variant 21]: "Don't let other people determine your own self-worth. You're your own person, and it's important to not evaluate yourself from the lens of others, but from yourself! Think of it like... not comparing yourself to someone better than you, but comparing yourself to how you used to be, it helps you improve!"\n\n
          - hg[Variant 22]: "Grass beats water, Water beats fire, and fire beats grass! It's a simple set of rules, it's basically just rock paper scissors, but learning the match-ups is important!"\n\n

          - hg[Variant 27]: "Non-disclosure agreements, or NDAs, are contracts that prevent people from discussing certain topics, typically used for actors and people who work in the media. There are loopholes to them though, if you read them closely you might be able to leak facts early, like a game's existence!"
