  !!DLEMULATOR EID:"namerelfemulator" SID:"start" URL:"/assets/bussim/emulatorData/namerelf.json"

  - hg[Variant 1]: "Yooo, how ya doin'?"
  - hg[Variant 2]: "Hey, how'd you get up here?"
  - hg[Variant 3]: "What's up?"
      - hg[Option 1]: What's with the clothes?
          - "Oh, you mean this? Yeah, uh, I dunno! I just threw this on today. No thought into it!"
              - hg[Option 2]: I'm not sure that's appropriate to be wearing.
                  - "What?! Sure it is! I think... I, uh, haven't looked in a mirror today, so I hope it is..."
                      - Relatable, I guess.
      - hg[Option 2]: What are you doing here?
          - "Well uh, I just got tired of standing in one spot all day. Those pedestals look nice, sure, but its sooo tiring to keep a pose. No clue how those other guys do it! Although, I hope more people actually come up and visit.. It's nice to be recognized for my work.."
      - hg[Option 3]: Just passing by.
          - "Oh okay, see you around!"
      - hg[Option 4]: Who are you?
          - "I'm NamerElf, you can just call me Namer though. I made this entire cave-- don't tell that wolf dude down there though!"
              - hg[Option 1]: Don't tell them..? Why?
                  - "Wellll, it's not for any nefarious reason.. They just kinda walked up in here and started living here, and I thought it was kinda cool to have a roomie. He.. Kinda doesn't know I'm here. Or that I was here first."
                      - hg[Option 1]: And you never introduced yourself?
                          - "No... I was planning on it, but I think he's too comfy at this point... No way am I stepping into a wolf's territory!"
                      - hg[Option 2]: Kind of goofy, but okay.
                          - "I be in situations sometimes."
              - hg[Option 2]: You made this?
                  - "Yep! Wasn't easy, but I carved out this whole cave with, uh.. The Roblox Studio build tools..?"
              - hg[Option 3]: Ah, okay.
