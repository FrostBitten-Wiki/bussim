  ##[Info]
  Bus Birthday is an event where a random player is chosen to be celebrated for their birthday.
  The player will get a [Birthday Ice Cream](birthday-ice-cream) instantly, and everyone will get [Free-modelled Cake](free-modelled-cake) shortly.
  "Happy birthday to you" will be played during the event, but on kazoo.
  A large part will also hover above the bus, emitting particle confetti over it.
  The event then ends, however you'll keep both items until you die.

  ##[Dialogue]
  - hg[Event]: "Hey, it's [Player]'s birthday right now!"
    - hg[You]: "Happy birthday!"
    - hg[You]: "Happy birthday to you AND the bus!" (Only available during Bus Simulator's official birthdays.)
      - h[After some time has passed...]
        - hg[Player]: "Free (modelled) cake for everyone!"

  ##[Trivia]
  - The birthday player is completely random and while it happening during your real birthday is purely coincidental, it is completely possible!
  - There's a chance that the player will not recieve the [Birthday Ice Cream](birthday-ice-cream), even if they were chosen as the birthday person.
  - The event has 45 seconds of runtime, which has the exact same amount of runtime as both the [In The Sky](in-the-sky) and the Space events. There's also a really similar runtime with the [Exploiter](exploiter) event.
  - The audio originated from a [birthday kazoo youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N63GSop8Xz4) that was published in Sep 16, 2014.
