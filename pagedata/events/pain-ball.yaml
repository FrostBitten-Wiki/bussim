  ##[Info]
  The Pain Ball is a short, but very loud event where a ball will be slammed into the windshield, causing screams of pain in the process. Eventually after a while of screaming, the driver finds a way to wipe it off of the windshield, and it succeeds, ending the event. 
  \n\n 
  The ball is also collidable both inside and outside of the bus, providing a temporary platform. 
  ##[Dialogue]
  - hg[Event]: "I think I-- OH GOD WHAT IS THAT?!"
    - h[After 70 seconds have passed...]
      - hg[Event]: "It looks like the ball is falling off of the windshield."
  ##[Trivia]
  - This is a reference to a roblox game Steven_Scripts has made called [balls of pain](https://www.roblox.com/games/2179700750/balls-of-pain).
  - The screams are actually from Sr Pelos "Underpants" mini-series. Specifically using Sans, and two from Asgore.
