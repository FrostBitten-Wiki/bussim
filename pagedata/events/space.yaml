  ##[Info]
  The Space Event is an event in Bus Simulator, where the map is instantly changed to be in space.
  \n\n
  During this event, all players' gravity will be drastically reduced, with gravity-related items like the [Gas Station Gravity Coil](gas-station-gravity-coil) being able to make players shoot up into outer space. Eventually though, the event soon ends as gravity resumes back to normal.
  ##[Dialogue]
  - hg[EVENT]: "Houston, we have a big problem."
    - hg[Houston]: "fix it yourself im on break"
  ##[Trivia]
  - The map used during the event is almost the same as the Void, however the time is set to night instead. 
    - Another event, called [In The Sky](in-the-sky) also uses the same event too.
