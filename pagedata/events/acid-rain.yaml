  ##[Info]
  Acid Rain is an event where acid starts raining from the sky, damaging everyone as long as the sky is exposed, 
  whether it'd be outside, by the stairs, or even the third floor. The event can be easily avoided if you stay on the second floor, 
  or if the bus is in a tunnel.

  The damage during most of the event is enough to outpace healing items, however in the last stage it isn't fast enough to outpace 
  [Cola](cola), [Homemade Coffee](homemade-coffee), and other healing items.

  ##[Dialogue]
  - hg[Event]: "It's acid raining! Find shelter!"
    - hg[You]: "why are you like this mother nature"
      - h[After some time has passed...]
        - hg[Player]: "It looks like the rain's calming down."

  ##[Trivia]
  - The acid rain used to be physical parts, and would heavily lag the game, depending on how many players are in the server.
  - Any parts made using btools (gained via admin commands) can protect players from the acid rain, although the particles will still spawn and fall past the parts, dealing no damage.
  - Acid rain is a real phenomenon, albeit much weaker and is usually caused by pollution and elevated acidity.

  ##[Technical Trivia]
  - Unlike other events, this particular event doesn't have any __Height Immunity__ and instead checks if the player's HumanoidRootPart has any collidable part above it, whether it'd be from the base game or from [F3X](edit) with its range being around 65 studs high. If it succeeds: you won't take any damage, otherwise you will.
    - When using commands or items that allows you to resize your character, the studs required for you to not take damage will also change significantly, albeit not drastically.
