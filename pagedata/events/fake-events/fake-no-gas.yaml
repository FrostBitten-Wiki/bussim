  ##[Info]
  The Fake No Gas event is an event where the bus stops, and the driver acts like they're out of gas. \n
  Shortly afterwards, pranking the passengers once again, acting as a sequel to the Stop event. 

  ##[Dialogue]
  - hg[Event]: "Wait i think we are out of gas."
    - hg[You]: "That's bad."
      - hg[Event]: "Ha! It was a distraction again!"

  ##[Trivia]
  - This is one of the shortest, being behind Stop (and by technically, the Backwalls), only lasting 20 seconds.
