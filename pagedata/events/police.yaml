  ##[Info]
  The Police event is an event that happens every 5 minutes. During this event, the police starts to pursue the Bus due to reasons perhaps related to the current Bus Driver. The Bus however, speeds up in retaliation. As a result, throughout the event players will be subjected to high speeds as the police continues to catch up in response. 
  \n\n 
  Eventually though, the Bus manages to drive fast enough for the police to drop the pursuit, as the event ends thereafter.
