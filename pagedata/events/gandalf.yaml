  ##[Info]
  The Gandalf event is a reference to The Lord of the Rings, where Gandalf stops the bus while yelling "YOU SHALL NOT PASS!" \n
  This lasts for quite a while eventually causing the driver to become impatient. Eventually Gandalf disappears and the Bus continues its journey as usual.

  ##[Dialogue]
  - hg[Gandalf]: "YOU SHALL NOT PASS!"
    - hg[Event]: "What the?"
      - h[After a while...]
        - hg[Event]: "I am losing patience."
          - hg[EVENT]: "He teleported out of here.. Lets keep riding!"

  ##[Trivia]
  - This event is a good opportunity to get some [Ice Cream](ice-cream) from the Ice Cream truck if its near the bus.
  - You can stand on the bubble surrounding Gandalf until it disappears after the event ends.
