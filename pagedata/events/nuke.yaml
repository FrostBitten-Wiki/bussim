  ##[Info]
  The Nuke event is a very simple event where the bus stops to take a break, figuring out what object is flying down in the distance.. only to find out that it's a nuke that's being dropped near them. Soon after, nuclear alarms start blaring in the background, as the bus quickly speeds up to very fast speeds just grazing the nuclear blast.
  \n\n 
  The event ends then after.

  ##[Trivia]
  - Before March 22, 2022, the music used to be [Screech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUT-GjQXdOI), from PAYDAY 2.
    - You can also do an Advanced Force Event specifically for this, but you *definitely* shouldn't pick this event. (120 R$ down the drain!)
  - This event has undeniably the most amount of dialogue combinations in the entire game, totalling at 1,783,600 dialogue options. (AS of prior to 3/1/2025)
  - This event icon was actually helped by Enthalpy (@axioenth), adapting from FangedWerewolf's original submission of the icon to improve the lighting and visceral of the event.
