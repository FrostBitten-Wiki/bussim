  ##[Info]
  The Lava Floor, or commonly known as The Floor is Lava event, is a sudden, yet deadly event in Bus Simulator, where for the remainder of 32 seconds, stepping on the floor on any level of the bus will swiftly deal 3 damage.
  \n\n 
  To avoid the damage, simply sitting on a chair or anything but the floor works. You can also use [Helicopter](helicopter) or [Hoverboots](hoverboots) to fly away from the ground or use healing items such as [Cola](cola) to outpace the damage.
  \n 
  You may also use the [Magic Mirror](magic-mirror) to teleport to the Glacier Cave to avoid the event entirely, or be stuck inside of the [Backwalls](backwalls), as only the main area is where the event is applicable. 

  ##[Dialogue]
  - hg[EVENT]: "The floor is lava!!!"
    - hg[You]: "AHHHHH"

  ##[Trivia]
  - Back then, this event used to count seats and props as lava and had a silent, yet deadly system, giving itself its infamy for being the most deadliest event in the game. This was later changed by Red (@RedNoob5050) to make it only count floors, and deal swift but noticable damage.
  ##[Technical Trivia] 
  - This event similar to others is exempted when it comes to h[Height Immunity], which is to say that at above 5,000 studs from the origin, events like this won't apply. Areas that are above or around this level are the [Void Room](void-box), [Glacier Cave](glacier-cave), and the [Backwalls](backwalls), thus giving them their event immunity traits.
