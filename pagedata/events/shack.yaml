  ##[Info]
  The Shack is an event in Bus Simulator, where the Bus stops at an abandoned shack, within the shack contains a ['Rocket Launcher'](fake-rocket-launcher) that will explode the holder on use, a [Gun](gun-in-bus-simulator) just above it, and [Paint Buckets](paint-bucket) collected into the left corner of the shack.

  The shack also has scattered trash everywhere, lots and lots of it, in fact.
