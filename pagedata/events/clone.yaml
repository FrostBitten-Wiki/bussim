  ##[Info]
  The Clone Event is an event in Bus Simulator where the bus gets cloned out of nowhere. Soon enough though, it turns out to be unstable and disappears shortly after.
  \n\n 
  In the cloned bus you may find everything relatively normal from the normal bus, but the driver seat isn't working properly, the radio and driver seat are broken, the Simon Says gamepad is missing with an unknown note in its place, the [Cold Cola] cooler is spilled, and more off-putting changes. Rarely, you might even find an older generation of [The Bus](the-bus) instead of the normal one.

  ##[Dialogue]
  - hg[Event]: "The bus got cloned!"
    - hg[You]: "Intriguing."
      - h[After some time has passed...]
        - hg[Event]: "The clone seems to be unstable..."
          - hg[Event]: "it's gonna disappear!"

  ##[Trivia]
  - It isn't recommended to jump to the cloned bus and vice versa while inside a tunnel, as you can very much fall inbetween the gap. And while it's a bit unnecessary as it is, you can use either [Hoverboots](hoverboots) or [Helicopter](helicopter) to easily travel between the two busses.
  - This is one of the more earlier events in this game, and also has a chance to include the older version of the bus.
  - Despite the name suggesting it being a clone, it doesn't clone any modifications to the Bus like Seasonal Changes nor Edits.
  - Attempting to flush yourself down the toilet in the cloned bus will not send you to the [Art Gallery](art-gallery), but instead the afterlife. Or, in other words, you just explode and die.
  - Even in the cloned bus, there still lies a cinderblock on the gas pedal, with the dialogue played being the following "Even this scuffed up cloned bus comes with a cinder block...".
  - The cloned bus has hexidecimal code where the "update note" usually is. When translated, the top text simply says "easter egg", whilst the bottom text says "was all that typing worth it?". poking fun at the player for decoding said paper.
