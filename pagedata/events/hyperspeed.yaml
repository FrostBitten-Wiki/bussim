  ##[Info]
  The Hyperspeed event is an event that causes the bus to suddenly speed up, and a yellow trail is emitted from the tires. As well as this, a portion of the instrumental of [*Running in the 90's*](https://youtu.be/8WEe-MmC4ag) by **Max Coveri** plays during the event. The bus headlights also glitches out for the duration of the event.
