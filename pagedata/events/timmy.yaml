  ##[Info]
  The Timmy Event is a short yet simple event in Bus Simulator. When this event happens, the Bus will move backwards rather than forwards, and the gravity being significantly reduced.

  ##[Dialogue]
    - hg[Player]: "Timmy broke the laws of physics again."
      - hg[You]: "Timmy, I swear!"

  ##[Trivia]
  - In one of the [news articles](news), Timmy has been mentioned a couple of times before, being: hg["Timmy turner falsely got arrested after allegedly breaking the world"] and hg["Okay, timmy fell down a well again. Does anybody have a rope?"]
    - The Timmy event's icon is also a massive reference to the second line mentioning Timmy alongside the [Nermal Trashcan](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nermal-in-trashcan) meme, in which Jon Arbuckle looks inside a trash can to see a passed out Nermal, seemingly dead and laying with the other trash.
  - This event also appears in the game that is probably canon to Bus Simulator, called [Bus Stop Simulator](https://www.roblox.com/games/1029063110/Bus-Stop-Simulator) by Steven_Scripts.
  - The 30-second runtime for this event makes it really similar to the [Bus Stop Riders](bus-stop-riders) event's runtime.
  - Timmy used to have a theme that would play [Frolic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-fUGBfJHCY) that was produced by h[Luciano Michelini], it was used in the sitcom [Curb Your Enthusiasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb_Your_Enthusiasm).
    - It no longer plays because of the h[March 22, 2022] audio update.
