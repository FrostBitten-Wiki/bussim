  ##[Info]
  The Clone Event is an event in Bus Simulator, where the bus gets cloned. Eventually it turns out it's unstable and disappears shortly after.
  \n\n 
  In the cloned bus you may find everything from the normal bus, but the driver seat isn't working properly, the next stop and eyes are different, and some features aren't usable. 

  ##[Dialogue]
  - hg[Event]: "The bus got cloned!"
    - hg[You]: "Intriguing."
      - h[After some time has passed...]
        - hg[Event]: "The clone seems to be unstable..."
          - hg[Event]: "it's gonna disappear!"

  ##[Trivia]
  - It isn't recommended to jump to the cloned bus and vice versa while inside a tunnel, as you can very much fall inbetween the gap. And while it's a bit unnecessary as it is, you can use either [Hoverboots](hoverboots) or [Helicopter](helicopter) to easily travel between the two busses.
  - This is one of the more earlier events in this game, which is also why the cloned bus has less features as it's an older version of [The Bus](the-bus).
  - Despite the name suggesting it being a clone, it doesn't clone any modifications to the Bus like Seasonal Changes nor Edits.
