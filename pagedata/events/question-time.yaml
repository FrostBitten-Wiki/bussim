  ##[Trivia]
  - If the same event happens twice, the tags you select won't stack onto each other, but are rather replaced.
  - This is the only event in the game that actively gives out tags without relying on group roles, donation, among other things.
  - The runtime for this event is 1 minute and 17 seconds, which has the exact same runtime as the [Nuke](nuke) event.
  - The event icon is a direct reference to the question "Milk and cereal? Cereal and milk?", which is basically how one makes their cereal, whether its milk first or cereal first, but general consensus says that cereal first is the only correct option.
