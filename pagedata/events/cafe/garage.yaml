  ##[Info]
  The Cafe is an event in Bus Simulator, being akin of that to Goat Station in terms of cast and similarities. 
  \n
  When the event starts, The Bus arrives in a city in the middle of the road. The driver then tells everyone to explore around, as The Bus stops on its tracks near a cafe.
  \n\n
  Throughout the duration of the event, players will be able to go around the city and talk to various NPCs, as well as providing different tasks for Passenger Reputation and Coins as compensation. The many NPCs you can find here are: Zeon, NobleReign, Tazer, MLG, and some new ones being: Sakura, Inro, Charlotte (Green Goat), and Foxman.

  ##[The Garage]
  "What's up? Need somethin'?" -"Tazer"
  The Garage is a location situated near Sparkplug Cafe within the city, run by Tazer. You'll be able to customize your Mini-Bus to the E-Bus from one of NobleReign's games: Mini-Bus Racing for the cost of <b>4,500</b> Coins, afterwards once it has been paid for; you'll be able to change it back to the original, and vice versa for free.
  \n\n
  You can also talk to Tazer about various topics as well, such as the school he used to be sent in, jokes, and his own special drink, in the form of a riddle.
  \n
  ##[Trivia]
  - This is also the only event in the game that allows you to customize your Mini-Bus outside of !color.
   - The design for the E-Bus is also made by Inro.
