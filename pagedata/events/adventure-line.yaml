  ##[Info]
  The Adventure Line is an event based off of the Stanley Parable, 
  and is about the riders of the bus following The Adventure Line^(TM).
  The line leads into a sewer grate, and the music is a lower quality version of the original version from the game. 
  The event lasts just short of a minute.

  ##[Dialogue]
  - hg[The Narrator]: "Players decided to follow the adventure line."
    - h[After 45 seconds...]
      - hg[Event]: "I think I've already seen this somewhere.. Lets go, 15 seconds."

  ##[Trivia]
  - The Adventure Line^(TM) is impossible to follow by walking on the path directly without use of Hoverboots, Helicopter, climbing in VR, or even using a Mini-Bus glitch, due to the line going upwards several dozen studs, and having a totally flat surface.
  - The audio being lower resolution was potentially due to bypass the ROBLOX audio system, so it can be played in the game.
