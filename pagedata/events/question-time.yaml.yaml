  ##[Trivia]
  - If the same event happens twice, the tags you select won't stack onto each other, but are rather replaced.
  - This is the only event in the game that actively gives out tags without relying on group roles, donation, among other things.
  - The runtime for this event is 1 minute and 17 seconds, which has the exact same runtime as the [Nuke](nuke) event.
