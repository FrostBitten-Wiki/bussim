  ##[Info]
  The Backwalls Bloxdonalds is an area found within the [Backwalls](backwalls), handled by [Red](red) once again. 
  \n\n 
  In this area, you'll be able to buy various items from the Backwalls in exchange for [Coins](coins). You can also ask Red various things and explore the kitchen, in which you can find various interactables that provides self-dialogue. [Pear](pear) will also often arrive here, standing by. 
  \n\n 
  There's currently 4 items that you can buy, with half of them being temporary; but useful.

  |[Void Burger](void-burger)|80 / Free (If you have 0 Coins)|
  |[Liquid Void](liquid-void)|800|
  \n\n 
  Aside from the items being sold here, there's also a lot of interactable props within the kitchen, all of them are as follows:
  |Props / Furniture|Description|Dialogue|
  |-----------------|-----------|--------|
  |Liquid Dispenser|A liquid dispenser with a strange, dark liquid inside. A sticky note next to it says "secret stock! DO NOT TOUCH -D". Interacting with it says the following.|"What is this stuff? And who is ''D''??|
  |The Bulletin Board|A bulletin board that contains various materials, showing the Employee of the Month, a Do Not Serve, work schedule filled with missing staff, and a normal calendar that simply says "October 2007". Interacting with the Employee of the Month photos or the DO NOT SERVE says the following.|Employee of the Month\n\n"Uh... Who took the photo?"\n\nDo Not Serve\n\n"Twelve whole cents... Outrageous."|
  |A "Sandwich"|A sandwich that's colored darker than normal, sitting next to another burger. Interacting with it says the following.|"Uh... *some* kind of sandwich..."\n\n"Yeah no, I'm not touching that. Who knows how long it's been out here for?"|
  |Red's Diary|A diary made by [Red](red) himself. Interacting with it says the following.|"It's Red's diary. Peek inside?"\n\n - hg[Option 1]: Just a little peek...\n\n"*You pick it up and take a look inside...*"\n\n-"*...and discover nothing. There's not a single page inside of this thing - it's just an empty cover.*" (Unlocks [Red](red)'s 6th Dialogue Option) \n\n- hg[Option 2]: Leave it alone.|
  |Broken Clock|A broken clock that hangs on the wall. Interacting with it says the following.|"A wall clock, reading half past twelve."\n\n"Looks like the battery's gone though, it isn't moving at all."|

  ##[Trivia]
  - Based off of [Red](red)'s comments and the bulletin board within the [Backwalls](backwalls), a few assumptions can be made about the business. 
    - It's a corporation that attempts to serve "the universe and beyond" with access to technologies to teleport into areas even out of reality. This means it may not be the second time we see Bloxdonalds running in business.
    - [efeuc](efeuc) is wanted within Bloxdonalds for making it lose an "irrecoverable h[12c] in losses". He is also meant to be detained on sight. 
    - Both [Steven](steven) and [MLG](mlg) used to work at Bloxdonalds, but one [vanished](steven-ride), while the other [moved away](goat-station).
  - It is the only event that allows you to spend [Coins](coins) on non-permanent items / special-condition permanent items. 
  - It is possible to purchase an item while already having one in your inventory, allowing you to save up multiple [Almond Waters](almond-water) or [Void Burgers](void-burger) for the remainder of your trip.
