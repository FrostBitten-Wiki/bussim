  "To the bus driver: you'd better scramble like an egg, before I *FOLD YOU* like an *OMLETTE*." -"Pear"

  ##[Info]

  Pear Takes The Wheel is an unique event to where [Pear](npcs/pear) overthrows the current bus driver, and starts driving instead.
  This event is a great way to gain [Reputation](others/reputation) if you have a very low amount, and is also a great way to get to other events quickly, 
  a couple including the [Backwalls](events/backwalls), the [Glacier Cave](events/glacier-cave), 
  the [Cafe](events/cafe), [Bloxdonalds](events/bloxdonalds), [Noble's House](events/nobles-house) and many more.

  \n\n

  When the event starts, Pear will complain about another event starting, 
  and then decide to take over the bus. 
  When this happens Pear will walk downstairs and kick the current driver off the seat. 
  Pear can also not be kicked off of the drivers seat, 
  with unqiue dialogue attached to it.

  ##[Unique Behaviours]

  Some unique changes that happens on this event is the normal reputation counter changes to text saying "i dont need your rep thanks though", 
  the regular note changes to a drawing of Pear, 
  and the [TV channel](others/tv) is changed to a channel only seen in this event, containing Pear.

  \n\n

  When thanking Pear, instead of what happens typically, 
  Pear will double the amount of reputation and give it to the person that has the smallest amount of reputation. 
  This is why this event is such a great and easy way to gain reputation if your low on it. If the player with the lowest amount of reputation thanks Pear or a player has thanked Pear already, nothing will happen besides some dialogue. You also can only thank Pear every 1 day.
