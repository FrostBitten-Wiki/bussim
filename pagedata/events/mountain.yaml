  ##[Info]
  The Mountain is a pretty basic event in Bus Simulator, where the bus stops at a nearby mountain with a lake and some ducks that occassionally quack. After a while the driver tells everyone to get back to the bus, and the event ends.
  \n\n 
  You can also take some of [the larger ducks](mountain-duck), and will stay inside your inventory until your untimely demise. Apparently they like busses too.

  ##[Dialogue]
  - hg[Event]: "Hey look at those mountains!"
    - hg[You]: "Looks pretty cool."
      - h[After some time has passed...]
        - hg[Event]: "Stop looking at the mountains. We're leaving in 20 seconds."

  ##[Trivia]
  - The models for the mountains are always kept constant due to when the mountains was first released, being before biomes existed. Therefore regardless of biome the model won't change.
  - If this event rolls in the [Lava](lava) biome, its water is non-collidable. As a result, you will end up being burnt just by stepping on it.
    - Likewise, if it happens on an [Overseas](overseas) biome, jumping into the lake will make you fall onto the ocean. Oops!
  - This was one of the events added in the poll for the next events, despite it being placed 2nd, it still got added later on.
  - After this event's debut, many people wanted this event to be removed due to the inaccuracy to actual mountains and the lack of anything special to it, however after following a poll in the Bus SImulator Updates discord server, it was decided to keep it in. 
    - It still has not been updated ever since, but never removed.
