  ##[Info]
  Steven Ride event or known as Steven_Scripts (Event), is an event that is almost identical to the [Bus Stop Riders](bus-stop-riders) event in Bus Simulator.
  \n\n
  When this event happens, a black figurine will appear in front of the bus, after the driver allows the mysterious figure to go inside the bus, it is then revealed to be Steven_Scripts himself.
  \n\n
  The event afterwards will function the same with Steven_Scripts having an assigned timer on random, and jumping off once it expires. If Steven_Scripts' timer expires whilst the Bus is stopped however, Steven_Scripts will briefly do a quick dialogue before flying into space.
  \n\n
  If however the [Backwalls](backwalls) happens before Steven_Scripts can jump off, you will find him in the Backwalls, violently sobbing in one of the rooms.
  \n\n
  Lastly, if the same exact event happens while Steven_Scripts is still on the bus, it will instead show a stone statue in a T-pose, before the driver promptly runs it over.
  
  ##[Dialogue]
  ###[Intro Dialogue]
  - EVENT: "What the..?"
  - ???: "Hey, I need to get somewhere! Let me in!"
  - Player: "..ookay?"
  - Player: "I don't know about this..."
  - Steven_Scripts: "Take me to the next stop."
  - Player: "Hey, it's--"
  - Steven_Scripts: "shhhhHHH. We all know already. Get going."
  
  ###[Exit Dialogue]
  - Steven_Scripts: "Hey! You just drove past my stop, you friggin-"
  - Steven_Scripts: "Agh, Max is gonna be so mad if I din't catch it. Gotta go!"
  - EVENT: "The event is *truly* over!"

  ###[If Steven_Scripts doesn't die...]
  - Steven_Scripts: "Oh, I'm alive."
  - Steven_Scripts: "Well bye"

  ###[If Steven_Scripts was sent to the Backwalls before leaving...]
  - Steven_Scripts: *violent sobbing*

  ###[If the Steven Ride is chosen again before Steven_Scripts can leave...]
  - EVENT: "Oh god, not anothe--"
  - EVENT: "Actually, that's just a rock. Huh."

  ##[Trivia]  
  - While you may not be able to see Steven_Scripts at first glance during his introduction, the harmonica sound effect will still play before and after the introduction.
    - The harmonica sound effect is also be distorted if you spot him in the [Backwalls](backwalls).
  - If Steven_Scripts ride on the Bus and all of the seats in the first floor are filled, Steven_Scripts will instead sit down next to the bathroom, defeated.
  - Unlike the [Steven_Scripts](steven) found behind [Bloxdonalds](bloxdonalds), you can't talk nor interact with him in any way.
    - You can't also annoy both [Steven_Scripts](steven) using the [Airhorn](airhorn), however depending on his position you might accidentally annoy [Pear](pear).
  - The pickup only takes 25 seconds, however the time the event is \*truly\* over is random.
  - Steven_Scripts actually changes his name in the End Dialogue, where he is referred to as Steven instead.
  - Steven_Scripts also T-Poses before entering the Bus, akin to his other version where it is a Stone Statue if Steven's already in the Bus.
