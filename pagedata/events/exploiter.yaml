  ##[Info]
  The Exploiter event is an event where an exploiter (of which is not a real exploiter) deletes the road and the terrain. \n 
  Shortly after some comedic stabs at the creator of the game, the terrain and road restore themselves back to normal, and everything returns back to normal. 

  ##[Dialogue]
  - hg[Event]: "An exploiter just deleted the map..."
    - hg[You]: "Wow..."
      - h[After some time has passed...]
        - hg[???]: "Hang on, I might have the solution..."
          - h[After a little more...]
            - hg[???]: "Okay, it should be back any second now."

  ##[Trivia]
  - The Falling in the Sky Event and the Exploiter Event are the only events in which the bus floats / flies.
  - This is one of the few events that forcibly changes the scenery outside of the bus.
  - You can still trip and ragdoll during this event, mainly because the map is set to be invisible rather than actually being deleted.
