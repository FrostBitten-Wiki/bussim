      Biomes appear randomly after driving through a tunnel, and they don't have any relation to events most of the time, unless if a specific event forces it (i.e. Blizzard).\n\n
      Biomes aren't also entirely random, as depending on what the players' [quests](pears-place) they currently have, they will greatly increase the chance of a specific biome related to them appearing.
