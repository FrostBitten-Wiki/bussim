  ##[Info]
  Bus Simulator is a game that was created in 2018 on ROBLOX, and was made as a small little socialization project at first,
  but kept getting more updates from there, taking on many expansive updates that immerse you in the comedic world of events on a bus that is
  forever waiting for its real stop, unsure if you will actually reach it.
