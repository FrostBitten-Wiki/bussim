      !!INFOBOX TITLE:"Early Access Content / Beta Content on or with Existing Content" COLOR:"#33D6FF" TEXT:"*\"Don't mind the mess!\"* - Fang\nv(This category has slightly new content reserved for a future update, which includes a whole bunch of new stuff, and is here to make editing post-update easier. Most of the info shown are with the discretion that it may not hold up to the base game.)"\n
      Events are a main staple in Bus Simulator, happening every 5 minutes after
      the last, or 4 if the server just started.

      <br><br>

      There are a bunch of events in the game. Ranging from smaller events,
      like looking at a mountain, all the way to a nuclear explosion and time travel.
      The pages go more in-depth about what goes on in the event, what items could be
      obtained, etc.

      <br><br>

      All of the icons shown are in sync with [Rider's event icons](rider), all being made by FangedWerewolf (@noobbiom) with a contribution added on top of it here and there! In-game screenshots will be presented as well within each event's individual pages or on display if a Rider event icon isn't available, as well as older iterations / representations by NotFunnyClown (@orfriday36) for events that were unable to be photographed prior to Rider's existence.

      <br><br>

      Note: If you are to force these events in a VIP server via the !event command, the event names are **Case Sensitive**.
      (i.e. Bloxdonalds won't be forced if you spell it with all UPPERCASE or lowercase.)
