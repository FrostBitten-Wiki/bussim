  *Not to be confused with [Edit](edit), the actual building tools.*
  ##[Info]
  FakeBuildTools is an item obtained from the [Btools](btools-event) Event or from [Pear's Place](pears-place) for 5 [Coins](coins) once unlocked / obtained once, where it simply changes color upon interacting, attempting to mimic actual building tools.
  \n\n
  The tool cannot have brighter colors (i.e. Shades of White), to prevent the labels on the cube from being unreadable.

  ##[Trivia]
  - It is  perhaps the second most useless, with [Tool](tool) being the most useless of all. 
  - While it is possible to assume one has BTools, the model used for the actual tools alongside the colors are widely different.
