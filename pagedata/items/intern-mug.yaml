  ##[Info]
  The Intern Mugs are a collection of mugs from the [Cafe Event](cafe). When held, the appearance given is randomized alongside its description, but its healing properties still remain the same. You can only obtain and hold one at a time normally.

  ##[Obtaining]
  In order to obtain one, you need to go within Sparkplug and head into their coffee making area. Then you'll need to ignore the UI that pops up and click on the red button within the Coffee Makers, the same machines next to the Empty Cups tray.
  \n\n 
  You can also obtain one afterwards from [Pear's Place](pears-place) for 50 [Coins](coins) once unlocked / obtained once.
  \n\n
  Afterwards, wait for a while and it should brew. Collect the pot part of the maker and you'll recieve the mug.

  ##[Trivia]
  - The Twilight Daycare Veteran mug is referencing The Hunt, an official event on Roblox where it was part of the many games needed to obtain items. 
    - Likewise, due to its unfitting nature compared to other games like Combat Warriors, Fruit Battlegrounds and the like, it was one of the most mentally punishing game of all just for the idea of it.
  - The "No, this isn't how you are supposed to play the game!" is the tool-tip for the intern mug prior to its randomization.
