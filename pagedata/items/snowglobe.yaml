  ##[Info]
  The Snowglobe is a permanent item obtained by joining during either the 2019 Christmas event, or the 20 Million Visits event, which was also situated around Christmas. During both of these events, you had a 50/50 chance to get either the Snowglobe or the [Snowcone](snowcone). 
  \n\n 
  When used, the player shakes the Snowglobe, making blue-white sparkles. It has no other practical use as it cannot heal, distract NPCs, or damage you. 

  ##[Trivia] 
  - Despite the Snowglobe making sound when used, it surprisingly doesn't attract the NPCs in [Santa's Gone](santas-gone) and [No Dough](no-dough).
    - Alongside that, it isn't taken away in the two events mentioned either. The Backwalls, however, will take it away.
