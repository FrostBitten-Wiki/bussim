  ##[Info]
  The Paint Bucket is an item obtained from the [Shack](shack) event. When used, the paint bucket's lid will be peeled off, and can be thrown to splatter paint according to the contents within that bucket. The tossing arc will also be in the direction of your cursor, taking around a second or two to charge up the paint bucket before it is thrown.
