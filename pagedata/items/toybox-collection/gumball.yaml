  ##[Info]
  The Gumballs are a collection of items purchased from the [Goat Station](goat-station) event for 25 [Coins](coins) each. 
  \n\n 
  When used, your character will blow out a large bubble colored by the respective gumball before popping soon after.

  ##[Technical Trivia]
  - Despite it being a really obscure feature unless you buy gumballs in bulk, purchased gumballs always avoid the color of one that already exists within the player's inventory, allowing each gumball to be completely different in terms of color.
