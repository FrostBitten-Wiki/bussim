  ##[Info]
  Lemonade is a VIP / Admin-Exclusive item in Bus Simulator that acts similarly to Lemon Soda, perhaps being the original Lemon Soda prior to being scrapped.
  \n\n
  It also shares the same functionality, dealing around 20 damage as well as inflicting nausea on your character. 
  
  ##[Trivia]
  - There exists a Lemonade item in Bus Stop Simulator, perhaps where this item originated from too; crafted by using a Lemon and a Cup from Bloxdonalds. 
    - The one in Bus Stop Simulator though isn't particularly known for inflicting nausea.
