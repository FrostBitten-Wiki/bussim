  ##[Info]
  The Starter Box is an obtainable item from the 10 Million Visits event. Appearing as a purple and violet present, the item can be opened with left click giving you all the items on [The Bus](the-bus), being: [Cola](cola), [Hot Cola](hot-cola), [Cold Cola](cold-cola), [Cramped Cola](cramped-cola), [Pizza](pizza), [Gameboy Advance](gameboy-advance), [Sign](sign), and [Marker](marker).
  \n\n 
  The box is likely a reskin of the "Royal Gift of Kings" hat from 2016/2017, in which the gift was part of a set of similar items which could be bought for large sums of robux to unbox into a limited item after a period of time. 

  ##[Trivia] 
  - This item used to only give all but the [Marker](marker) and [Pizza](pizza), due to the former being released after the box and the latter being an oversight. It was then changed to include both to the box 2 years after release.
