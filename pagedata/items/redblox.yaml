  ##[Info]
  RedBlox is an item in the [Goat Station Event](goat-station) or from [Pear's Place](pears-place) for 80 [Coins](coins) once unlocked / obtained once, and is a one-time use that makes you walk faster for a few seconds, like the [Hyper Soda](hyper-soda). 
  \n\n 
  This effect however, wears down over time, and unlike the other items on sale in Goated Gas, both this and the [Goala Cola](goala-cola) aren't purchasable due to them being so cheap. 
  
  ##[Trivia]
  - The item is based off of the official gear, which is also based off of a real-life product, Redbull.
