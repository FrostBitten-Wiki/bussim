  ##[Info]
  The Birthday Ice Cream is a large ice cream in a cone. During the [Birthday](birthday) event, when a random player has been picked in that event, the player will get the Birthday Ice Cream item in their inventory immediately. 
  \n\n 
  Surprisingly, this item is also quite good at short burst healing, with it's healing speed surpassing the [Cola](cola), and [Homemade Coffee](homemade-coffee), but it lacks the duration, which requires you to constantly use it. 
  \n\n 
  You can also try and give it to [Frost](frostbite) only for him to reject it because it's too big to consume. 
  \n 
  The easiest way to get this would either to be in a private server all by yourself (either yours or someone else's) or in a very low populated public server.

  ##[Trivia]
  - Sometimes when being selected in the [Birthday](birthday) event, it won't be given to you arbitrarily, nobody knows how or why.
