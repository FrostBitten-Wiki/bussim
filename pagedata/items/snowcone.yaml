  ##[Info]
  The Snowcone is a permanent healing item obtainable from either the 2019 Christmas event or the 20 Million Visits event, during which, you had a 50/50 chance to get either it or the [Snowglobe](snowglobe). 
  \n\n 
  On use, you will be healed a small amount, but with a very short cooldown, allowing rapid consumption. 

  ##[Trivia] 
  - This item has CanCollide enabled, which is presumably unintended.
    - This also applies to [Popsicle](popsicle), and [Candied Cane](candied-cane). 
  
  ##[Technical Trivia]
  - It is currently possible to utilize this item as a form of teleportation, first use the item multiple times then unequip it at the first spot. Secondly, go to any spot outside of your first spot and drink the [Cramped Cola](cramped-cola), and lastly: equip the Snowcone again. This will force you to teleport back to your first spot at any point in the game. 
    - The same can apply to both [Popsicle](popsicle), and [Candied Cane](candied-cane), but are more inaccurate and prone to flinging you.
