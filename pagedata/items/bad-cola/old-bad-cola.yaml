  ##[Info]
  The OldBadCola was presumably the original Bad Cola that became deprecated following the new and current version, and it can be shown by how it functions as both the mechanic and texture seem to be missing. 
  \n\n 
  You can still drink it however and it won't kill you and it'll still produce the same sound as the current. It is unknown when or why it was replaced. 

  ##[Trivia]
  - Despite the texture being swiftly removed, it is possible to view it for a split second, being the current Bad Cola texture. 
    - When using Edit, you'll also see that after the removal both the Mesh and Texture are identical to the Bloxy Cola mesh, being 10470609.
  - Despite it being a Cola, it still doesn't heal you.
