  ##[Info]
  The Exit Explorer Map is an item that is used within the [Backwalls](backwalls) to draw out areas you have already explored and marking the escape room with a large X. 
  \n\n 
  To obtain this, you must talk to [Red](red) within the [Backwalls Bloxdonalds](bloxdonalds-backwalls), and ask for Something Else. After asking him for an exit plus a cost of [5 Passenger Reputation](reputation), he will then give you the map.
  \n\n 
  Its appearance and function is similarly as the [Buried Treasure Map](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Explorer_Map#Buried_Treasure), with a large cross and a player locator for whoever holds the map, however it also marks areas like Bloxdonalds if found.
  \n 
  You will also need to have a [Compass](compass) to be able to see your character's direction on the map, giving it a use.

  ##[Trivia]
  - Attempting to look down using your third-person camera or up in first-person will flatten the map. 
  - Using the map may cause your character to trip or clip outside of bounds within the area since your animation changes.
  - This is perhaps the first two items that cooperates with each other, namely with the [Compass](compass).
  - Attempting to click while holding the map will allow you to punch similarlly in Minecraft, it won't harm anyone though.
