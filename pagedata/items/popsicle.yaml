  ##[Info]
  Popsicle is a permanent healing item obtained from the 10 Million Event Wheel. 
  \n\n 
  When used, it'll heal you by a significant amount similarly to [Snowcone](snowcone) and can be used quite rapidly. Despite that though, it is a good healing starter item to have. 

  ##[Trivia] 
  - The popsicle is based off the Rocket Popsicles, or "Firecrackers" by Popsicle(R) P O P S I C L E.
  - Interestingly enough though, it has collision similar to [Snowcone](snowcone) and [Candied Cane](candied-cane).

  ##[Technical Trivia]
  - It is currently possible to utilize this item as a form of teleportation, first use the item multiple times then unequip it at the first spot. Secondly, go to any spot outside of your first spot and drink the [Cramped Cola](cramped-cola), and lastly: equip the Popsicle again. This will force you to teleport back to your first spot at any point in the game. 
    - The same can apply to both [Snowcone](snowcone), and [Candied Cane](candied-cane), with the former being more specific and the latter being more inaccurate.
