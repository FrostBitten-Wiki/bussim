  ##[Info]
  The Gas Station Gravity Coil is a tool obtainable by purchasing it for 415 [Coins](coins) during the [Goat Station Event](goat-station), or for free by stealing it. Stealing the item will always be temporary.
  \n\n 
  Upon equipping, your character's gravity will be reduced by a small amount, less than half as effective as the normal Gravity Coil.
  \n\n 
  It'll also play a flangey sounding gravity coil sound effect, further driving the idea that this is a weaker item than one would expect. 
  ##[Trivia]
  - Prior to the Phone Overhaul, this used to cost [15 Passenger Reputation](reputation) during its debut.
