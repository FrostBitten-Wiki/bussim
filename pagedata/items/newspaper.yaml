  ##[Info]
  The Newspaper is an item as part of the Roleplay / Filler set. Like all the other items within this set, these don't possess any practical functionality.
  \n\n
  When held, it shows a messy collection of pages dating back to... May 5th 2009. It is surprisingly in pristine condition still.

  ##[Trivia]
  - Due to some of the pages being in the same position as the others, Z-fighting can occur.
    - Z-fighting is basically two textures fighting to be at the top because both textures from two parts conflict with each other on the same plane.
