  ##[Info]
  The I-O-U note (or simply called I-O-U within the inventory) is a permanent placeholder item, added to celebrate Bus Simulator's 7th Birthday. Its appearance is a simple note with the text being randomized by a list.
  \n
  From June 14 to 18th 2025 (or 15th to 19th for EST), spanning a total of four days, players automatically recieve the item permanently, unlike previous birthdays were it was permanent under special conditions. (Eg. Bus Birthday [Cake](bus-birthday-cake) / [Pie]](bus-birthday-pie)). Beyond that however, this item will (assuming there's no change of plans) be replaced entirely by a different item. It will also be unobtainable beyond June 18th.
  \n\n 
  Upon using it, the following dialogue appears:
  - hg[Note from Noble (the developer)]: "thank you for logging in on the bus simulator birthday"
  - hg[Note from Noble (the developer)]: "i couldn't really do anything for this year cause of a bunch of different factors. still i thought something would be better than nothing"
  - hg[Note from Noble (the developer)]: "thank you for still playing despite that, i couldn't ever imagine that i'd be developing the game for this long"
  - hg[Note from Noble (the developer)]: "i'm still working on a new update, although it'll be a while. i have a lot of stuff planned for it"
  - hg[Note from Noble (the developer)]: "once that comes out, this little note should have changed into something cooler. keep an eye out for that."
  - hg[Note from Noble (the developer)]: "thanks and i hope to see you around soon"
    - The player then recieves 3,500 Coins. (Archived)
    - The player loses 1 Coin.

  ##[Trivia]
  - This item is of course, a placeholder item, and will likely be replaced with something better to fit with the anniversary.
    - But there is a chance that you will still keep the note, which it has as of current. (September 25, 2025)
  - The note used to somehow give players who read it already another 3.5k when rejoining, and another, and another. 
    - It was patch swiftly after, and now takes away 1 Coin instead.
  - The note's text is different everytime the player resets / joins, the following are what's possible to have on your note:
    - "lazy developer??>"
    - "patience is key"
    - "this will be something cooler later"
    - "my bad"
    - "happy birthday???"
    - "i-o-u"
    - "sorrrryyy"
    - "permanent paper"
