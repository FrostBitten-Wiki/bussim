  ##[Info]
  The Spronkbib Popsicle is obtainable along with The Last One badge as a 1/800 (formerly 1/1000) chance from the naturally spawning ice cream vans.
  \n\n 
  Once you do get it though, you won't be able to get another normal [Ice Cream](ice-cream) without having to delete the Last One badge <12px>([But why would you?]), or by giving it to [D6](d6) during the [Goat Station](goat-station) event in exchange for the [Tool](tool). 
  \n\n 
  When held it plays the Steel String sound effect from Spongebob Squarepants and upon licking it, the player will receive rapid health regeneration for a short time. 
  \n\n 
  It is currently obtainable in a VIP server. 

  ##[Trivia]
  - The popsicle itself is based off of the real-life version of the Spongebob popsicles.
  - The Spronkbib Popsicle used to be a temporary item, but was changed in the 20 Million Visits update, making it permanent. 
  - While it may not seem like much, the Spronkbib Popsicle isn't removed from the Backwalls, Santa's Gone, and No Dough, making it a slightly overpowered item in said events. 
    - In Backwalls you can use this to heal rapidly from dark goo puddles.
    - In No Dough and Santa's Gone, it works as a good distraction without the Airhorn.
