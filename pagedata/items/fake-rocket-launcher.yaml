  ##[Info]
  The Fake Rocket Launcher is an item obtained in the [Shack](shack) event. 
  \n\n 
  When used, it will at first seem to sound like a normal rocket launcher from Roblox, but will instead explode the person who holds this item instead, It can't also be used to kill other players if you are standing next to them. 

  ##[Trivia]
  - This item is an almost exact replica of the classic Roblox Rocket Launcher added in June 2006. You can find more info about the original in the Roblox Wiki!
  - The tool appears to shoot out a blue rocket in the direction you choose when clicked, but the rocket itself doesn't explode, and ignores collision.
  - The tool has its gripped reverse meaning where it fires is supposed to be backwards, but still shoots forward when using it.
