  ##[Info]
  The Popcorn Bucket is a permanent item that can be obtained from the Backwalls, and requires a [Bucket?](bucket) found in Zeon's house in the [Goat Station](goat-station) event or from the [Picnic](picnic) event, [Kernels](kernels) from [Goat Station](goat-station) and finding a perfect condition popcorn machine within the [Backwalls](backwalls). 
  \n\n
  *(Note: You cannot permanently obtain Popcorn in private servers. The Popcorn Bucket is initially a temporary item when first obtained, and is only permanent once you properly escape with it. Resetting doesn't count as escaping.)*
  \n\n
  When you find one, you have to pour the kernels into the machine by clicking on it, and then wait two minutes for the machine to stop making noise, which indicates that it's done. Click on it again, and you'll receive the Popcorn Bucket. Now, you have to escape with it to receive the item permanently.
  \n\n
  You can also try to used a cursed popcorn machine too (Popcorn machines that are rusted in its corners and have broken lights in the lettering are considered Cursed), but it may have some [**serious implications**](daryl), nonetheless you can interact with it once it's done to receive your popcorn. 
  \n\n 
  To eat the popcorn, simply click, tap, or press RT/R2 on console and it'll restore your health by a small but rapid margin (+10 HP). And to throw, press Q or X/Square on console and attempting to throw it at someone will heal them drastically (+15 HP), allowing it to be an effective (and only) cooperative healing item in the game. 
  \n\n 
  For VR players, holding the popcorn bucket allows you to grab a handful by using your other hand, from there, you can use it to manually feed yourself or to throw in much more specific arc compared to other consoles.
  ##[Trivia]
  - The popcorn kernels, bucket, and machine was all made by ComeOutTheCloset_1.
  ##[Technical Trivia]
  - The popcorn is actually buttered, as hinted in the internal parts of the Popcorn Maker in the Backwalls, with the part name being: "itcomeswithbutter".
