  ##[Info]
  The Candied Cane is a healing item given by obtaining The Bringer of Gifts badge from the Santa's Gone event. 
  \n\n
  When held, it will give you a mild speed boost, and on top of that, clicking will also heal you and provide an extra speed boost. 

  ##[Trivia] 
  - This item has a slower cooldown than most healing items, e.g. the colas.
  - The item makes a very quiet "Tunk" sound when equipped, and can only be heard in super quiet environments (i.e. Glaicer Cave) and/or with headphones on.

  ##[Technical Trivia] 
  - It is currently possible to utilize this item as a form of teleportation, first use the item multiple times then unequip it at the first spot. Secondly, go to any spot outside of your first spot and drink the [Cramped Cola](cramped-cola), and lastly: equip the Candied Cane again. This will force you to teleport back to your first spot at any point in the game. 
    - The same applies for [Snowcone](snowcone) and likely [Popsicle](popsicle), with the former being most precise, and the latter being likely inaccurate.
    - Do note though, that it occasionally slows you down for one-life per teleport. So it's recommend to use it wisely.
