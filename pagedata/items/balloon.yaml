  ##[Info]
  The Balloon is a permanent item only gifted to those who have a Contributor or higher role in the Bus Simulator Fan Group. 
  \n\n 
  When held, it'll show your custom balloon depending on the account, otherwise it'll instead show as a green balloon. You can pop it as well to receive another color, but afterwards won't be able to get your custom balloon unless you press Q in which it'll reset back to your contributor-only ballon.
  \n\n 
  It also decreases your gravity by a significant amount, similar of that to the Roblox Gravity Coil, making it an indirect upgrade from the Gas Station Gravity Coil.

  ##[Get Well Soon Balloons]
  These balloons are unique in design, and can only be seen if a player with the Balloon equips it when ragdolled. Image designs aren't tied to a specific contributor, and is randomized every time it's requipped. The player can keep the balloon design when unragdolled, but reverts back to a regular one when a player unequips and requips it.
