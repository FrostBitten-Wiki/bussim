  ##[Info]
  The Cold Cola is a variant of Colas that can be either found on the third floor of [The Bus](the-bus), or inside of [Glacier Cave](glacier-cave). It is inside of a mini fridge with a few other cold colas.
  \n\n 
  Upon drinking, the player will freeze for around 4 seconds and thaws after 6 seconds after freezing. The player will also jump regardless if it's standing on solid ground or not once thawed. 
  \n\n 
  The thawing can also be affected by gravity related items such as [Gas Station Gravity Coil](gas-station-gravity-coil) and can be used as a means of a double jump, allowing you to access some more vertical-related areas without the use of the [Helicopter](helicopter). 
  \n\n 
  Drinking the cold cola after being set on fire by the [Hot Cola](hot-cola) will stop the fire. 
  ##[Trivia]
  - Back then, drinking the cold cola would put the player inside a large ice cube. This was eventually changed so the player's avatar turns to ice.
  - Drinking the cola and waiting a few seconds to jump off the bus will freeze you in midair. This could... potentially be useful?
