 ##[Info]
 The Hot Chocolate is a special consumable obtained by talking to [Pear](pear) while you are in a [Snowy](snowy) or [Frozen](frozen) biome or from [Pear's Place](pears-place) for 100 [Coins](coins) anytime and anywhere after obtaining it for the first time.
 \n\n 
 When consumed, you'll heal rapidly for 50 HP following a short delay, which is particularly helpful to prolong yourself against a [Blizzard](blizzard).
 \n\n 
 The mug also has a unique sipping animation which differs from other drink tools. 

 ##[Appearance]
 The mug reads "CAT PERSON :3", in a more basic font.
 \n 
 It is also colored with green and yellow stripes, similar to Pear, and has hot cocoa with marshmallows inside. 
 \n
 The mug also produces a faint steam effect when held out. 
 \n\n
 Drinking it would cause the player to receive a visible fog coming out the mouth, replicating condensation. 

 ##[Trivia]
 - This item was made by ComeOutTheCloset_1, who also made the Popcorn Bucket and Balloon items.
 - The delay is based upon the gulp in Cola's drink sound.
 - It isn't clear if this is the same or different than the kind of hot cocoa that can be made in the Cafe.
 - Despite the drink being hot, it doesn't have the ability to burn you, unlike the [Hot Cola](hot-cola).
