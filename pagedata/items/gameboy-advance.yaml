  ##[Info]
  The Gameboy Advance is a item that can be found on the first floor of the bus, and it allows you to play 1v1 games with somebody else who also has the item out. You also used to start with this item during Bus Simulator's 6th Birthday Event.
  \n\n 
  If you own the Game Cartridge gamepass or were present during the entirety of Bus Simulator's 6th Birthday, (or assuming you found a free cartridge in [Noble's House](noble-house)) you can host games with other players, with a total of five games you can choose from.
  \n\n
  When you start a match with somebody, there will be a Link Cable connected to both of the players' consoles, specifically to the port on top.

  ##[Trivia]
  - Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Battle Wagons are official ROBLOX items that you can buy, but they're currently broken and non-functional.
  - The game's title on the Cartridge is called "Bus Routes", and has a map of bus routes on it.
  - This is one of the two Nintendo references in the entire game, other one being the [Cubes Event](cubes).
  - The original mesh uploader is unknown.
  - There's no link cable length limit between both players when they're in a match, meaning you can still play with somebody at different locations.
  - The startup sound when you equip the Gameboy Advance used to be a beta Operating System bootup noise for Codename "Longhorn", which later became the Windows Vista. A clearer version can be heard on Youtube. Unfortunately, it was removed due to a copyright claim.
