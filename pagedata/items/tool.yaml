  ##[Info]
  Tool is a temporary item that can be obtained after giving D6 a food or drink item (permanent items, such as the Snowcone, also count).
  \n\n
  When triggering his dialogue asking for food, you have to deny it, where he barters to give you the tool, then accept it.

  ##[Trivia]
  - It is the most useless item in the game because it does nothing.
