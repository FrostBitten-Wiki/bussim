  ##[Info]
  Tool is a temporary item that can be obtained after giving [D6](d6) within the back of [GOATed Gas](goat-station) a food or drink item after denying the first deal from his "Tell me." dialogue talking about food, which is a 1/16 chance. (Permanent items, such as the Snowcone, also count)
  \n\n
  When triggering his dialogue asking for food, you have to deny it, where he barters to give you the tool, then accept it. If [D6](d6) takes one of your permanent items, you can reset to have it back.

  ##[Trivia]
  - It is the most useless item in the game because it does nothing.
