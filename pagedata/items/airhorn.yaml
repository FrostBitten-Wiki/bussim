  ##[Info]
  The Airhorn is an item obtained by purchasing its titular gamepass, costing 275R$; making it the second most expensive right behind the Licensed Barista. 
  \n\n 
  When used it produces a loud sound from where the player used it, and has no cooldown on use allowing players to freely spam it, much to the inconvinience of others.
  \n\n
  Despite its original use being to annoy players, you can use it in various events such as [No Dough](no-dough) / [Santa's Gone](santas-gone) to distract the NPCs, luring them into the origin of sound which makes this useful if a bunch of NPCs are patrolling the exit / destination, or in the [Backwalls](backwalls) to notify other passengers about your presence.
  \n\n
  You can also use it next to other NPCs to annoy them, but beware that some of them won't act kind in retaliation.

  ##[Trivia]
  - It uses the Airhorn sound used for meme culture.
  - It also made its appearance in Kit Battle's Meme Boi Kit, where you can use the Airhorn to knockback players in a large range.
  - While you can distract the house guests in [No Dough](no-dough) / [Santa's Gone](santas-gone), you can't use it in the [Backwalls](backwalls) to distract the [Entities](entity).
  - Despite it producing a loud sound, it can't echo in the caves, the bus, nor in the Backwalls.
  - This was originally the only gamepass item that has a badge locked behind it on the badge's release, being the [DEFENESTRATED badge](https://www.roblox.com/badges/2141806851/DEFENESTRATED). It was only until [Stanley](stanley) was introduced, allowing you both a cost-free and a costly way to get defenestrated.
  #![comment tip: just mute your tool volume for the airhorn to be muted!!! its that simple!!!!]
