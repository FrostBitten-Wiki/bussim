  ##[Info]
  The Expired Taco is a gear obtained from the [Time Travel Event](time-travel) or from [Pear's Place](pears-place) for 10 [Coins](coins) once unlocked / obtained once, and is obtained at the "taco stand!!!!!!." 
  \n\n 
  The taco appears to have a green tint, and deals 75 damage to the player. Much more dangerous than the [Burger](burger) from the [Bloxdonalds](bloxdonalds) event.
