  ##[Info]
  The Expired Taco is a gear obtained from the [Time Travel Event](time-travel), and is obtained at the "taco stand!!!!!!." 
  \n\n 
  The taco appears to have a green tint, and deals 75 damage to the player. Much more dangerous than the [Burger](burger) from the [Bloxdonalds](bloxdonalds) event.
