  ##[Info]
  Hot Cola is an item that can be found on the second-story of [The Bus](the-bus) underneath the [Pizza Box](pizza).
  \n\n
  When used, it'll act as any normal Cola; but will instead set you ablaze, with high pitched oof noises being produced and fire coming out of your head as your entire body darkens.
  \n\n 
  After a few seconds after consumption, you'll instantly die. 
  \n\n
  This can however be prevented by consuming [Cold Cola](cold-cola) right after, freezing you and preventing you from death. It doesn't prevent the lasting effects however. 

  ##[Trivia]
  - Despite its functionality, it doesn't work during the [Blizzard Event](blizzard).
  - While using this and the Cold Cola thereafter can prevent you from dying; doing this conversely doesn't automatically extinguish the Hot Cola's effects.
