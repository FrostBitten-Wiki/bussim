  ##[Info]
  The Lemon Soda is an item in Bus Simulator that is obtained from its own respective event or from [Pear's Place](pears-place) for 10 [Coins](coins) once unlocked / obtained once. When drank, it deals 25 damage to the player, and causes nausea as well. Spitting noises may also be heard. 

  ##[Trivia]
  - In one of the many news reports, the anchor states that their dog died drinking lemon soda. This alludes to the fact that it damages players upon consumption, and dogs are easily hurt as well. 
    - The driver also mentions it killing their dog before the event ends.
  - Although the damage may be substantial for one, it is heaps less dangerous compared to other colas like [Bad Cola](bad-cola), which instantly kills you.
