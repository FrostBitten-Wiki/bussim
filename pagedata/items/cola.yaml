  ##[Info]
  The Cola is an item that is obtainable at the Second floor, or from the [Starter Box](starter-box) if you got that from the 10 Million Visits event. Using it will heal you. The cola is one of the best healing items. 
  \n\n 
  It is located inside of a crate, with several other colas. Upon clicking on it, there's a 10%(?) chance you will get the [Bad Cola](bad-cola). You can also find it within a cooler during the [Goat Station](goat-station) event.
  \n\n 
  If the current month is October however, all instances of the normal Cola are replaced by Witches' Brew instead, and the drink inside would be green instead of the usual brown.

  ##[Info (Backwalls)]
  "Well that was uncanny." -"Cola (Backwalls)"
  Another interaction that the Cola can provide is if paired with the [Bus Birthday Cake](bus-birthday-cake) during Bus Simulator's 5th Birthday. When consumed last, you'll be forcibly teleported to the [Backwalls](backwalls). With the Cola having a new tooltip, do note however that both the Cola and Cake are one-time uses afterwards.
