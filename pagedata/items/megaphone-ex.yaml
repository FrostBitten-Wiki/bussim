  ##[Info]
  The Megaphone EX is a now unlisted gamepass item that used to cost <clr:#45ff45>(R$320). It was taken off of the gamepass store following the merge into the new TextChatService since April 30th, 2025, and has since not returned.
  \n\n 
  It has however, gained new perks ever since the introduction of [MORSE](morse), with those who already have it gaining free extra perks alongside the base perks!
  \n\n 
   It is an upgraded version of the original Megaphone, as your shout message is 22.22..% larger than normal messages, and your cooldown varies upon your message size. 
  \n\n 
  You can also change the color by using !mcolor.

  ##[Trivia] 
  - Inr_o made the model for the Megaphone.
