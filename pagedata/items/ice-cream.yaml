  ##[Info]
  The Ice Cream is an edible item that is obtained from the ice cream truck or from [Pear's Place](pears-place) for 20 [Coins](coins) once unlocked / obtained once.
  \n\n 
  You can only obtain it naturally by waiting for an event where The Bus stops, as the Ice Cream truck moves along with The Bus, assuming you didn't already have an Ice Cream before hand, or a [Spronkbib Popsicle](spronkbib-popsicle). When consumed, it heals a miniscule amount of health.
  \n\n 
  If you own a [Mini-Bus](mini-bus), and The Bus has stopped, you can drive back to where the cars spawn, and wait for an Ice Cream truck to spawn, if you can get beyond the invisible barrier. 
  ##[Trivia]
  - Its one of the few items that can be obtained outside of events directly or on [The Bus](the-bus).
  - You can feed it to [Frost](frostbite) to gain 1 Trust, but do keep in mind you will still need to have a [Pearcoin](pearcoin) or a [Spronkbib Popsicle](spronkbib-popsicle) to be friends with him.
  - Before [Pear's Place](pears-place) was introduced, once you got the [Spronkbib Popsicle](spronkbib-popsicle), it was impossible to obtain this item as you would get denied ice cream if you have Spronkbib Popsicle in your inventory. 
    - Following the debut of Pear's Place however, you can now buy Ice Cream under the Nook of Knowledge section for 20 Coins, and is automatically unlocked if you have Spronkbib Popsicle.
