  ##[Info]
  The Burger is an edible item that is obtained from the [Bloxdonalds](bloxdonalds) event or from [Pear's Place](pears-place) for 10 [Coins](coins) once unlocked / obtained once. 
  \n\n 
  Its appearance is of that of the classic Cheezburger ROBLOX Gear. When the player consumes it, their screen becomes green, their camera jolts upwards going down, and it deals 25 health. 
  \n
  This only lasts a few seconds before the green screen disappears. 

  ##[Trivia]
  - The Bloxdonalds Burger along with the [Lemon Soda](lemon-soda) and [Expired Taco](expired-taco) are the only items known that makes the player take damage and give nausea.
  - Originally after the revamped NPC Dialogue was introduced, whenever you asked for a burger, you won't be able to proceed without taking a bite to end the conversation. Which while wasn't much forced people to eat it. 
    - Following the 20 Million Update, this was changed so that now the burger isn't automatically on your hands and you can proceed the conversation as normal.
