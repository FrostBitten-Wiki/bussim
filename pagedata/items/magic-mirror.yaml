  ##[Info]
  The Magic Mirror is an item obtained by returning to the [Glacier Cave](glacier-cave) after receiving the Animal Messenger badge from Frostbite's questline. 
  \n\n 
  On use, it will teleport you to the [Glacier Cave](glacier-cave), just several feet away from the [Frost](frostbite). Using it again next to the [Fake Window](glacier-cave) however, will teleport you back to [The Bus](the-bus).

  ##[Trivia]
  - This item, as well as the event and badges, was added with the 20 Million / Christmas update, but isn't a limited-time item.
  - This is a reference to an item of the same name from Terraria.
  - On September 10th, the neon mesh part of the Magic Mirror was moderated for no apparent reason, causing the item to look hollow compared the item shown in the Infobox. 
    - This has been fixed following after, with it having a similar appearance.
