  ##[Info]
  The Hoverboots is a pair of boots that allows you to fly, similar to the Helicopter item, only obtainable during the 10 Million Visits Event, or via Admin Commands.
  \n\n 
  To use the item, simply press the jump button while having it equipped to start flying, and you can click to have a speed boost while flying, which changes your particles to orange. However, the Hoverboots has limited fuel, and will turn off if you reach 0%, making you fall from whatever distance you were flying at. The item recharges when you're on the ground. 
  ##[Trivia] 
  - The item can also be seen with the Holo Kit from NobleReigns other game, Kit Battle.
