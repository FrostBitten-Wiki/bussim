  ##[Info]
  The Cramped Cola is a variant of the [Cola](cola) series, that is located on the 2nd floor of the bus. It's inside of a cupboard next to the pizza box. 
  \n\n 
  Upon drinking, it will begin to shrink your avatar, possibly giving access to some areas that require being small. Drinking again will result in becoming normal sized again. 
  \n
  Keep in mind each drink deals 30 (28 w/ health regen) damage, making it only consumable 4 times in quick succession. 
  \n\n 
  It also will disable you from using any items in your inventory while shrinking or expanding, mainly to prevent exploits and both your movement speed and jump power gets decreased significantly. 

  ##[Trivia]
  - At some point, Cramped Cola was reworked to have more realistic physics than before, as a result a lot of its internal mechanics were changed alongside different ways to go around issues. This also patched existing issues with the item beforehand. 
    - Despite this though, there now exists an item only given via Admin Commands called Cramped Cola_Old, which as stated in its title, works just like the Cramped Cola prior to it being reworked.

  ##[Technical Trivia]
  - It is currently possible to utilize this item as a form of teleportation, first use any item with collisions such as: [Candied Cane](candied-cane), [Snowcone](snowcone), and / or [Popsicle](popsicle) and then unequip it at the first spot. Secondly, go to any spot outside of your first spot and drink the Cramped Cola, and lastly: equip the item you used previously again. This will force you to teleport back to your first spot at any point in the game.
