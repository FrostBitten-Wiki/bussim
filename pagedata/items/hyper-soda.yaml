  ##[Info]
  The Hyper Soda is a soda variant that can be obtained at the top of the platform next to the sign in the [Obby Event](/bussim/events/obby).
  \n\n 
   When used, it will provide a similar speed compared to [Almond Water](/bussim/items/almond-water), but after a few seconds after consumption will massive spike in speed, overpowering many if not, all of the other speed items in the game. 
  \n\n 
  However, after around more than 10 seconds, you will lose all of your boosted speed and most of your normal walkspeed, making you slower without the help of other speed-related items. 
  \n 
  This effect usually resolves after a few minutes or by resetting, but it can be very bothersome to many. 
  ##[Trivia]
  - While it is appealing to have a drastic increase in speed, it's debuff afterwards can make exploration punishing especially in events like [Goat Station](/bussim/events/goated-gas-station) or [Backwalls](/bussim/events/backwalls) where movement speed is greatly utilized.
    - Items such as [Candied Cane](/bussim/items/candied-cane), [Redblox](/bussim/items/redblox), [Mini-Bus](/bussim/items/mini-bus), and [Almond Water](/bussim/items/almond-water) are better, albeit rarer and mostly limited alternatives.
