  ##[Info]
  Coffee is a usable item obtained from the pool event that appears next to the edges of the pool or from [Pear's Place](pears-place) for 20 [Coins](coins) once unlocked / obtained once. It is used much like a soda; however, it gives no additional effects. 
  \n\n 
  It appears to be a [Bloxdonald's](bloxdonalds) coffee (as can be told from a large yellow 'B') and bears significant resemblance to its real-world counterpart. 
  \n\n 
  The coffee is basically identical to the [Cola](cola), in speed, duration, and health regeneration only that this is less accessible, being in only one event.
