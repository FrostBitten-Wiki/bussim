 ##[Info]
 The Bucket? is an item obtainable within both Zeon's House during the [Goat Station](goat-station) event, the [Picnic](picnic) event or from [Pear's Place](pears-place) for 100 [Coins](coins) once unlocked / obtained once, and is mainly used to carry over to the Backwalls, where it's used as a vessel for the [Popcorn Bucket](popcorn-bucket). 
 \n\n
 This does nothing on its own and is more rather paired with [Kernels](kernels) and the Popcorn Machine to create the [Popcorn Bucket](popcorn-bucket).
