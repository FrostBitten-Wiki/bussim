  ##[Info]
  The Bus Birthday Cake was a limited-edition variant of the Free-modelled Cake, added to celebrate Bus Simulator's 5th Birthday.
  \n
  During the week after its introduction, you'll always start with this item. 
  \n\n 
  When consumed, it will heal you a tiny amount of health. However, if paired with [Cola](cola), you'll end up teleporting to the [Backwalls](backwalls). 
  \n
  This will also force you to trip upon entry, unlike the Backwalls event, where you simply teleport there.
  \n\n 
  The Backwalls itself follows the same principles as if you had entered using its titular event, however with a few changes: you'll keep the Cake and Cola (including its [other variant](bad-cola)), the Cola will have a new tooltip, and Pear will charge 20 Passenger Rep for a guide to the exit, as well as some new dialogue. Both the Cake and Cola are one-time use, however. 
  \n\n 
  "Tastes like... a never-ending party!... but also plastic. (from Bus Simulator's 5th birthday event)" -"Bus Birthday Cake (Permanent-Edition)"
  If you manage to escape with the Cake, you'll have around a 30% chance to permanently obtain it, making this cake a useful teleportation tool for gathering the last three items or to simply torment yourself. 
  \n\n
  You'll also recieve exclusive dialogue for acquiring it permanently: 
  - "Oh hey, escaping that time made you eligble for a funny perk..."
  - "You get to keep the birthday cake forever. Enjoy having a free, permanent window into the Backwalls."

  ##[Trivia]
  - This is the only item to have two badges linked to them. Being Plasticky Birthday Goodness, and Plasticky Cola Hell. 
    - It's also the second item that allows you to teleport to a location, the first being the Magic Mirror that leads you to the Glacier Cave.
  - The texture for the cake was made by Pixel_N3ko, otherwise known as Sakura_Floran. 
  - You can hear the "W.D. Gaster Fade" sound affect when somebody teleports to the Backwalls with the item.
