 ##[Info]
 The Frozen Chocolate is a special consumable obtained by talking to [Frostbite](frostbite) following specific actions or from [Pear's Place](pears-place) for 100 [Coins](coins) anytime and anywhere after obtaining it for the first time. You must also have max trust in him to gain access.
 \n\n 
 When consumed, you'll heal rapidly for 50 HP following a short delay, which is particularly helpful to prolong yourself against a [Blizzard](blizzard).
 \n\n 
 The mug also has a unique sipping animation which differs from other drink tools. 

 ##[Appearance]
 The mug reads "1# WOLF DAWG", in a more crude writing.
 \n 
 It is also colored sky blue similarly to Frostbite, and has chilled cocoa with ice cubes inside. 
 \n
 The mug also produces a faint mist effect when held out. 
 \n\n
 Drinking it would cause the player to receive a visible fog coming out the mouth, replicating condensation. 

 ##[Trivia]
 - This item was made by ComeOutTheCloset_1, who also made the Popcorn Bucket and Balloon items.
 - The delay is based upon the gulp in Cola's drink sound.
 - It isn't clear if this is the same or different than the kind of hot cocoa that can be made in the Cafe.
 - Despite the drink being frozen, it doesn't have the ability to freeze you, unlike the [Cold Cola](cold-cola).
