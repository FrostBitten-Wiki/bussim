  ##[Info]
  The Sparkler Candle is a VR-Exclusive permanent item that only appears in a VR players inventory, unless if given by an admin via admin commands. The sparkler is a light source, emitting vibrant sparks at the tip and creates a long-duration trail.
  \n\n 
  Just like the Sparkler, it is just a cosmetic item and disappears if you play Bus Simulator on any other platform but VR.
