  When eaten, you recieve the same effects as one would when drinking [Liquid Void](liquid-void), but with it being only a one-time use. It also takes away 33 of your health but without inflicting nausea. This makes it effective for quick getaways if you cannot afford the liquid variant.

  ##[Trivia]
  - This item unlike its [liquid version](liquid-void) is not permanent and will not carry over outside of the [Backwalls](backwalls).
