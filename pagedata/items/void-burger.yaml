  ##[Info] 
  The Void Burger is an item that can be bought from [Red](red) in the [Backwalls Bloxdonalds](bloxdonalds-backwalls) for 80 [Coins](coins) or for free if you have no Coins. it can also be bought from [Pear's Place](pears-place) for 650 [Coins](coins) once unlocked / obtained once.
  \n
  When eaten, you recieve the same effects as one would when drinking [Liquid Void](liquid-void), but with it being only a one-time use. It also takes away 33 of your health but without inflicting nausea. This makes it effective for quick getaways if you cannot afford the liquid variant.

  ##[Trivia]
  - This item unlike its [liquid version](liquid-void) is not permanent and will not carry over outside of the [Backwalls](backwalls).
  - Prior to the Phone Overhaul, this used to cost [2 Passenger Reputation](reputation) during its debut, and also had the same feature where being bankrupt in reputation would allow [Red](red) to give you the burger for free.
