 ##[Info]
 The Coffee from the [Cafe](cafe) Event is a customizable drink used with ingredients given to the player at any moment when interacting with the Coffee Machine, and is used to either give to NPCs or to drink from.
 \n\n
 When making one, the player will go into a focus-mode state, being able to pick any ingredients and measure them out carefully. Recipes are also provided on the left, with all of the specific ingredients needed to make a drink.
 \n\n
 While you do not need to be extremely accurate, as long as you have the appropriate ingredients; it'll blend into the drink that you want. 
 \n\n 
 You can also carry the drinks into the [Backwalls](backwalls), and the amount of usage depends entirely on how useful it can be within the [Backwalls](backwalls).

 ##[Ingredients]
 \n
 Ingredients are the main component in making coffee, with all of them boosting a stat or decreasing them. You can add as many as 32 of a solid ingredient, and 190 ml of a liquid / dry ingredient.
 Depending on the ingredients that you use will also depend on the stats that the coffee will recieve after making it. The stats are of the following:

 ##[Recipes and Mixtures]
 "This tastes so good. Trust." -"Mixture / Abomination"
 Recipes and Mixtures are one of the main mechanics when making coffee. Each recipe contains a list of ingredients and getting around that point (With varying strictness based on recipe overlap) will blend into the recipe that is closest. If otherwise, it'll instead be your personal concoction, with varying effects based on the ingredients you used.
 \n\n 
 All recipes (excluding ones involving absurd amounts of Dry Ingredients / The Sludge), all have uses of 3. When in the [Backwalls](backwalls), however, all unmentioned drinks are changed on a range of 1-6 based on its h[Sweetness] factor, making regenerative drinks scarce, while making other drinks but sweet more usable.
 \n\n 
 Lastly, the aforementioned drinks will have a use of 10 outside and inside of the [Backwalls](backwalls).

 ##[Mixtures]
 If the blend that you made is far from any of the preset recipes, it'll be a Mixture. Usually comprised of ingredients with weaker effects, but is customizable to your heart's desire.
 \n 
 The maximum for a Mixture is 4 ingredients.
 \n\n
 If the ingredients used are more than or equal to 5, it'll instead be ''A _, _, _, and _ abomination'', with the _ being the characteristics of the ingredients used. 
 \n\n
 The following goes by order from left to right and depends on the ingredients: 
 \n\n
 | Order | Tags | Requirements |
 |-------|------|-------------|
 |1|Cold|Cold Ingredients|
 |1|Warm|Hot Ingredients|
 |2|Sweet|High Sweetness|
 |2|Bitter|Low Sweetness|
 |3|Refreshing|High Quenchiness|
 |3|Torturous|Low Quenchiness|
 |4|Energizing|High Energy|
 |4|Tiring|Low Energy|
 \n
 Afterwards, the description and tooltip changes to any of the following between both the mixture and abomination:
 \n\n
 | Tooltip | Description |
 |---------|-------------|
 |Do you dare take a sip?| A [Display Name] Exclusive!|
 |It's part of a secret menu. Maybe.|Personal recipe!|
 |An unconventional combination...|This tastes so good. Trust.|
 |Even if others can't enjoy it, you still can.|You made it yourself!|
 |Probably tastes good maybe!|Yay!!!!!|
 \n\n
 If the ingredients used are more than or equal to 16, it'll become **The Sludge**. A drink so foul, that it invokes negative reactions all around. Still, maybe someone favors that sort of thing?
 \n 
 The tooltip and description changes as follows:
 \n\n
 | Tooltip | Description |
 |---------|-------------|
 |Knowing what's inside of this is... disconcerting, to say the least.|What the..? Nobody will like this.|
 \n\n 
 "Again???" -"The Sludge (Backwalls)"
 You can also arrive into the [Backwalls](backwalls) if paired with the [Bus Birthday Pie](bus-birthday-pie) during Bus Simulator's 6th birthday event. The effects of The Sludge still remains though even out of reality.
 \n
 ##[NPC Interactions]
 "That cafe does delivery? I don't remember ordering this.. but thanks." -"Zeon (Goat Station)"
 You're also able to give any type of coffee to the majority of the NPCs in the game, and it's also crucial to the Cafe's main mechanic where you give them to your [Customers](customers), with multiple interactions and even rewards as a result.
 The following are NPCs that can be gifted outside of [Customers](customers) and their favorite drinks, giving you Coins and Reputation as a reward with the Rep-Coin ratio being 1:70. Do note, that the reputation rewards are randomized to either [Passenger or Driver Reputation](reputation), and are claimable once every eight hours.
 \n\n
 | Name | Location | Favorite Drink | Rewards |

 \n
 You can also give the NPCs other drinks outside of their favored drink, however will either deny or try it out; taking it from your inventory.
 \n 
 You can also give them ***The Sludge.*** Although most would deny it, someone who is unfortunate enough might disregard it...
 ##[Trivia]
 - If you drink too much caffeine, you'll end up receiving a heart attack and die on the spot, text will also appear with the caption "drink caffeine responsibly".
   - This does not apply if you drink too much sugar. 
 - Having too much Dry ingredients within your drink can be almost fatal, as it'll always deal 99 damage and leave an audible gasp instead of the usual effects. 
 - Originally it was going to be a way to instantly die, but it's reserved for a future ingredient.
 - Having too much Glowstick Fluid within a cup will make it glow out of the cup hole.
 - Both the Empty Cup and its drinks will cause the player's gravity to be reset back to normal under the effects of the [Cramped Cola](cramped-cola), sinking the player quickly.
 - The Cup of Glowstick Fluid and the Glowstick Fluid ingredient are normally inaccessible, but become unlocked after you give Tazer the wrong drink and receiving his riddle.
 - Foxman is the only NPC that dies throughout the event of its appearance if fed the Sludge.
   - efeuc similarly dies as well if fed the Sludge, however respawns once nobody is in the [Void Box](void-box).
 - Ectta, unlike other NPCs, strangely is able to be given Coffee much earlier than the rest, allowing players to instantly give Ectta a drink once the lid has been placed.
 - There used to be a leaked recipe, although isn't present in the game due to the ingredients being far from accessible. The recipe in question is:
