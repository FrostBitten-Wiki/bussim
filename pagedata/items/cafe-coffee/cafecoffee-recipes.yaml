  ##[Info]
  The Coffee from the [Cafe](events/cafe) Event is a customizable drink used with ingredients given to the player at any moment when interacting with the Coffee Machine, and is used to either give to NPCs or to drink from.
  \n\n
  When making one, the player will go into a focus-mode state, being able to pick any ingredients and measure them out carefully. Recipes are also provided on the left, with all of the specific ingredients needed to make a drink.
  \n\n
  While you do not need to be extremely accurate, as long as you have the appropriate ingredients; it'll blend into the drink that you want.

  ##[Recipes and Mixtures]
  "This tastes so good. Trust." -"Mixture / Abomination"
  Recipes and Mixtures are one of the main mechanics when making coffee. Each recipe contains a list of ingredients and getting around that point (90% accuracy) will blend into the recipe that is closest. If otherwise, it'll instead be your personal concoction, with varying effects based on the ingredients you used.

  ##[Mixtures]
  If the blend that you made is far from any of the preset recipes, it'll be a Mixture. Usually comprised of ingredients with weaker effects, but is customizable to your heart's desire.
  \n 
  The maximum for a Mixture is 4 ingredients.
  \n\n
  If the ingredients used are more than or equal to 5, it'll instead be ''A _, _, _, and _ abomination'', with the _ being the characteristics of the ingredients used. 
  \n\n
  The following goes by order from left to right and depends on the ingredients: 
  \n\n
  | Order | Tags | Requirements |
  |-------|------|-------------|
  |1|Cold|Cold Ingredients|
  |1|Warm|Hot Ingredients|
  |2|Sweet|High Sweetness|
  |2|Bitter|Low Sweetness|
  |3|Refreshing|High Quenchiness|
  |3|Torturous|Low Quenchiness|
  |4|Energizing|High Energy|
  |4|Tiring|Low Energy|
  \n
  Afterwards, the description and tooltip changes to any of the following between both the mixture and abomination:
  \n\n
  | Tooltip | Description |
  |---------|-------------|
  |Do you dare take a sip?| A [Display Name] Exclusive!|
  |It's part of a secret menu. Maybe.|Personal recipe!|
  |An unconventional combination...|This tastes so good. Trust.|
  |Even if others can't enjoy it, you still can.|You made it yourself!|
  |Probably tastes good maybe!|Yay!!!!!|
  \n\n
  If the ingredients used are more than or equal to 16, it'll become **The Sludge**. A drink so foul, that it invokes negative reactions all around. Still, maybe someone favors that sort of thing?
  \n 
  The tooltip and description changes as follows:
  \n\n
  | Tooltip | Description |
  |---------|-------------|
  |Knowing what's inside of this is... disconcerting, to say the least.|What the..? Nobody will like this.|
  \n 
  ##[Trivia]

  | Name | Description | Recipe |
  |------|-------------|--------|
  |Catpurrcino|Gives that warm, fuzzy feeling to your stomach.|- 10ml cat\n- 10ml cat\n- 10ml cat|
