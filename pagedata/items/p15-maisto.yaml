  ##[Info]
  P15-Maisto is a temporary / permanent item in Bus Simulator, only obtained during the [New Years](new-years).
  \n\n
  During the New Years, one of the rewards that you can get is the P15-Maisto, a firework launcher that launches upwards to the skies.
  \n
  The firework bypasses any parts and will explode into particles once it reaches enough height. It cannot harm players and yourself in the process.
  \n\n
  Normally, this is a temporary item, disappearing once New Years ends in your timezone, however; if you received it as a keepsake for the 2023 New Years, it becomes a permanent item.

  ##[Appearance]
  The firework launcher is composed of a dark teal hollow cylinder, and various other parts welded together. The firework is also positioned near the end of the barrel.

  ##[Trivia]
  - This item was made by ComeOutTheCloset_1, who also made the Popcorn Bucket, the Balloon, and various other items.
  - During release of the 2023 New Years, this was meant to be rewarded alongside the [New Years Chocolate](new-years-chocolate), however it ended up being an Admin-Exclusive item through almost the entire event's duration.
   - As a result, a patch was made that would give players with the New Years Chocolate the P15-Maisto, now being a permanent keepsake. It is unknown, but very plausible that future New Years will feature it as a temporary item.
