  ##[Info]
  The Gas Station Ice Cream is a tool obtainable by purchasing it for 135 [Coins](coins) during the [Goat Station Event](goat-station), or for free by stealing it. Stealing the item will always be temporary.
  \n\n 
  The item works the same as the Ice Cream tool and other ice creams, except it plays a flangey 'Yummy' sound. It doesn't heal very well either.
  
  ##[Trivia]
  - Prior to the Phone Overhaul, this used to cost [8 Passenger Reputation](reputation) during its debut.
