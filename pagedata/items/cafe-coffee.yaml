 ##[Info]
 The Coffee from the [Cafe](cafe) Event is a customizable drink used with ingredients given to the player at any moment when interacting with the Coffee Machine, and is used to either give to NPCs or to drink from.
 \n\n
 When making one, the player will go into a focus-mode state, being able to pick any ingredients and measure them out carefully. Recipes are also provided on the left, with all of the specific ingredients needed to make a drink.
 \n\n
 While you do not need to be extremely accurate, as long as you have the appropriate ingredients; it'll blend into the drink that you want. 
 \n\n 
 You can also carry the drinks into the [Backwalls](backwalls), and the amount of usage depends entirely on how useful it can be within the [Backwalls](backwalls).

 ##[Trivia]
 - If you drink too much caffeine, you'll end up receiving a heart attack and die on the spot, text will also appear with the caption "drink caffeine responsibly".
   - This does not apply if you drink too much sugar.  
 - Having too much Dry ingredients within your drink can be almost fatal, as it'll always deal 99 damage and leave an audible gasp instead of the usual effects. 
  - Originally it was going to be a way to instantly die, but it's reserved for a future ingredient.
 - Having too much Glowstick Fluid within a cup will make it glow out of the cup hole.
 - Both the Empty Cup and its drinks will cause the player's gravity to be reset back to normal under the effects of the [Cramped Cola](cramped-cola), sinking the player quickly.
