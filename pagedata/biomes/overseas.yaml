  ##[Info]

  Unlike other biomes, This biome allows players to fall off the road, causing them to drown in the process. It is highly recommended you don't drive a [Minibus](minibus) recklessly here if you prefer to keep your inventory.

  ##[Trivia]
  -Overseas is a very bad biome to be in for certain events that are required on land like [No Dough](no-dough), [Gas Up](gas-up), [Glacier Cave](glacier-cave), and more.
    - Items that can make you fly or improve gravity can help such as [Helicopter](helicopter) or [Gas Station Gravity Coil](gas-station-gravity-coil)
  - It is possible to escape drowning on the waters below by hoping for a teleporation event like [Bought Out](bought-out) or [Backwalls](backwalls) to happen, or by using a [Magic Mirror](magic-mirror).
    - Items like [Helicopter](helicopter) unfortunately won't give you enough loft to survive.
  - Overseas is the only biome to have a road-like bridge, and also being one of the two more unique biomes, the other being [Lava](lava).
