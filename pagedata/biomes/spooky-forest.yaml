  "A dark creepy forest, rumoured to have a strange faceless figure living in it. Hence why it's called spooky." -"Rider (Almanac)"
  ##[Info]
  Spooky Forest is a biome submitted by  NotFunnyClown (@orfriday36). It is a biome that takes place on a dark forest, with trees, bushes, tents, and rarely. That figure.\n\nThe trees have a rare chance of containing a note stickered on its trunk, and very rarely, you can encounter that figure. It's harmless however. 
  ##[Trivia] 
  - The figure's name is called "Slenderpal", and is the nice version of Slenderman according to @orfriday36 and the note on the tree saying "HE CHILL".
    - It of course, is a direct reference and mention to Slenderman, a classic horror character infamous during the 2009's.
