    The Void biome is a biome that cannot be forced by the !biome command, but instead can be seen in two events, Exploiter and Glitches, as well as with the !map command. The biome appears completely blank and lacks a road. The collision for the road and ground exists, but it cannot be seen. Vehicles cannot spawn in this biome, either.
