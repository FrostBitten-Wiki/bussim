  ##[Info]
  The Dark Forest is a biome in Bus Simulator submitted by FangedWerewolf (@Noobbiom), and is meant to be a similar opposite to [Birch Forest](birch-forest). 
  \n\n 
  The biome features groups of large dark trees with large bushes, red and brown mushrooms scattered about. Unlike most biomes, light doesn't pierce well in this biome. 
  \n\n 
  Like other biomes, buildings can also spawn here.
  ##[Trivia]
  - Part of the idea-making when it came to the Dark Forest was due to FangedWerewolf getting lightheartedly annoyed seeing Birch Forest in all his sessions of Bus Simulator, and wanted to make another biome to add more variety.
