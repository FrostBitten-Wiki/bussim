  ##[Info]
  Lava is a biome comprised of lava surrounding the entire street with a potent orange haze for its fog. Any attempt to walk onto the lava will send you up in the skies, taking away your health in the process.

  - If any player touches the lava in this biome, it will cause them to jump and deal significant damage. It won't however trip them.
    - However, if a Mini-Bus were to drive on it, or assuming the player holds it; you won't take damage from it.
    - This used to be not the case back then when it was introduced, only tripping players. It was only added in the 20 Million Update.
    - This is may also be a reference to Super Mario 64, where if you were to be in contact with lava, Mario would jump and take damage as a result, similar to this.
