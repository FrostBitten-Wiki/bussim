  The Bus is the main part and theme of this entire game, it is composed of 3 different floors with about more than 40 seats distributed all over the floors including items and props. \n\n
  This is where everyone hangs out for most if not almost all of their entire time playing this game, with parts of it from [Events](events). \n 
  It also serves as an effective shelter for events that can kill players if outside, like [Blizzard](blizzard), [Acid Rain](acid-rain), [Flash Flood](flash-flood), etc.

  ##[Bus Design]
  The bus has a sleek design, with a primary accent of Navy Blue coat of paint that can be modified and a secondary accent of Black, and has 3 floors to explore / chill out on, with many windows throughout the initial two floors.
  \n\n 
  The tires, headlights, and backlights all have a lime outline, and the tires in specific have light gray rims.
  
  ##[1st Floor]
  The first floor is the spawn area and where the bus driver's seat is located. It consists of 12 seats, 2 seats per row, with the left front seat being the bus driver's seat. In the front there is a built-in FM radio, a steering wheel, pinned documents, and a PaRappa the Rapper plush.
  \n\n
  The sides contain multiple overhead compartments, which can be opened by clicking on them, showcasing several interesting scenes alongside a Gameboy Advance in the back left compartment, with the front right compartment allowing you to sit inside. In the back there is a set of stairs leading upwards to the 2nd level and a bathroom built into the stairs, with a mirror and toilet, flushing yourself down the toilet doesn't seem to do much though.
  \n\n
  In the corner of the stairs is a hidden entrance to a small room only accessible by being small yourself. Within it features a couch, TV of Family Guy, and various other furniture. There's also a door that leads you further into the small room, with arcade machines and beanbags.
    
  ##[2nd Floor]
  The second floor is an intermediate floor between the roof and the first floor, consisting of 12 seats, 2 seats per row, and 2 compartments you can sit on at the front and items scattered about.
  \n
  Within the floor consists of the Cola Crate, the Pizza Box, Cramped Cola stash, and Pear, with the first three giving you items and Pear being an NPC you can talk to with various topics.
  \n
  At the front of the floor, there'll be extra seats ontop of the compartments alongside two buttons, the left forces a specific event at the cost of 120R$, whilst the right force a random event for 60R$.
    
  ##[3rd Floor / Roof]
  The third floor, or the roof, is the uppermost floor of the bus. It has 12 seats, 2 seats per row, which are equally spaced out. The floor also includes two white bean bags, for a total of 14 seats. 
  \n\n 
  The floor also comprises of a patterned carpet with diamond plate running straight down the middle with soft lime safety light strips running across it. These cannot be disabled when disabling indoor lights. 
  \n\n
  Stuck in-between the middle right seat and the wall is a Sign which can be held. Near the back within the right side lies a wooden table with a functional Simon Says toy paired with a Marker, and a freezer containing Cold Colas. Lastly, in the far back is a ladder that brings you down to the 2nd Floor.
  \n\n
  There's also a rare chance whenever the server starts that a platform at the front will appear; with three mini-houses containing from left to right, Steven_Scripts, MiroCev, 4J3K, and NobleReign. 
    
  ##[Exterior]
  The exterior are the outside features of the bus which, while limited, can be used. 
  \n\n
  On the front, you'll be able to find both The Bus' headlights, and a sign that displays its next destination. The Bus' headlights possess a strange feature in which it has a sense of conscience by display emotions and blinking, while the sign forever shows Stevensville, MT. as its next destination.
  \n\n
  On the right side of the bus is a miniature bus stop that can be visited for those who used [Cramped Cola](cramped-cola), it can also be sat on the bench included or on the grass platform on the other side.
  \n\n
  And lastly, on the back of the Bus is a volatile cable which can be sat on. It also serves as a link cable to the Cloned Bus during its respective event. Also located on the back is a license plate which says RBLX2952 which flashes into THE BUS ISN'T STOPPING whenever the Bus blinks. 
  \n\n
  While there is nothing interesting underneath the bus, but there is a hidden button beside the back-right tire. Pressing the button will stop the bus (if it's moving), play "The Binding of Isaac - The Binding of Isaac" by Danny Baranowsky, and unlock the door. This can only be triggered once per server, and will remain unlocked until the server shuts down.
  \n\n
  ##[Holiday / Special Changes]
  As holidays or special occasions come, the bus changes its appearance to the fitting holiday automatically without having to restart all servers. They mostly apply for the whole month, with it reverting back to default once it's over. Any bus appearance changes, unless if it's a Birthday event, only changes in a new server.

  ##[Halloween / October]
  - During October, the bus will naturally turn black with orange string lights and headlights, a purple carpet, assortments of pumpkins, ghosts, and cobwebs, and Bat Confetti Launchers on the top floor that launch bats. The headlights also turn orange, and the hanging noob at the front of the bus turns into a Pumpkin.

  ##[Christmas / December]
  - During December, a Christmas Tree appears on the 3rd floor along with some festive lights, decorative candy canes, and white headlights. The hanging Noob also changes into a Christmas tree. The carpet will also turn into a pale light blue.

  ##[New Years / December 30 - January 1]
  - During New Years (December 30th - Jan 1st), firework launchers can be seen on the top floor, but nothing else changes.

  ##[Bus Simulator's 5th Birthday / July 15, 2023 - July 21, 2023]
  - On Bus Simulators' Fifth Birthday, a flag was put on the first floor, saying "Happy 5th Birthday Bus Simulator", and has a sticky note on the other side saying "Sorry if this is lazy. All our focus is on Kit Battle". This can only be seen from July 14th to July 21st, 2023. 

  ##[April Fools 2024]

    - 1st Floor

  ##[Trivia]
  - Because of the destination sign, some people have previously theorized that the creator lives in Stevensville, Montana. This, however, is not true. 
   - It is theorized that Bus Stop Simulator takes place in Montana as well.
  - Stevensville is a real location in Montana.
  - The Bus looks similar to the NB4L Bus on London, also called the New Routemaster or Borismaster. However with the roof as the 3rd Deck, only having 1 front door, And The steering wheel is on the left instead of the right like its London counterpart.
    - It is unknown if its still confirmed to be the same model with the new overhauled exterior / interior.
  - The Birthday flag was made by Pixel_N3ko.
  - For some reason, The Bus does not have a brake pedal.
  - The Bus originally had a much more simpler design, but has been reworked with the help of both Inr_o and Pear, with Inr_o making the new bus and Pear making the new seats.
    - Inr_o later than overhauled the design again, with Tazer being involved throughout the process.
  - The [No Dough](no-dough) event revealed that the bus is a hybrid, not actually needing gas.
    - This is later coincidentally proven furthermore, with the [No Gas](no-gas) event's inactivity condition, where the event ends even if nobody actually collected the gas canisters.
