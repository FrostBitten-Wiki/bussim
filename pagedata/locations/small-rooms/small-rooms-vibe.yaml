  ##[Vibe Room]
  The Vibe Room is an area only accessible from the door within the [Lounge](small-rooms-lounge).
  \n\n 
  The area contains a few arcade machines, changing colors ever so often; bean bags, couches, and posters from various medias such as Among Us and Hotline Miami. The area also has [Light Dreamer from Afro Dizzy](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/9047105702/) playing at all times.

  ##[Trivia]
  - Back when it was first introduced, the screens on the arcade machines were non-anchored, allowing players to knock them down intentionally or not. This was later patched in a future update.
