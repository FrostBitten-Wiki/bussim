  ##[Trivia]
  - The Plasticky Cola Goodness and Plasticky Cola Hell are both inspired from The Grimace Shake meme, where people would celebrate Grimace's birthday and drink his shake, only to be subsequently unconscious or die in horrific ways, typically accompanied with purple stains.
  - The Last One used to not give you a Spronkbib Popsicle on spawn when it was first introduced. It was only after the 20 Million Update that having the badge will give you the Spronkbib Popsicle.
